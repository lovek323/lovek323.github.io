# Bible Notes Series

Format:

- A note:
  - About something interesting other than the passage itself but related to
    this process

- The passage:
  - When starting a new book, a very brief overview of the themes of the book
  - A list of interesting things from the week's chapter
  - The verse I selected to focus on
  - An outline from a commentary I used (the IVP commentaries have been good)
  - Why I chose the verse (or verses) from the chapter
  - Discussion of the issues raised by the verse
