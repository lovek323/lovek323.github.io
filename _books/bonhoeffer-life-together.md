LIFE TOGETHER



This book has been on my reading list for a long time. I’ve listened to an
audiobook version, which I really enjoyed, but there’s no substitute for
sitting down and actually reading the text.



Why did I choose to read this now?



For the last several months, I’ve been meeting with a few other Christians and
we’ve started exploring more informal ideas of church and Christian community.
Now, in some ways, Life Together isn’t exactly the most obvious book for this.
Bonhoeffer was writing about a seminary community where people were training for
ordination. Bonhoeffer himself was steeped in a rather formal church tradition.
My community will look different from the one at Finkenwalde, often vastly
different. Nevertheless, one of the things I’ve been seeing more and more
clearly is just how high the calling of Christian community is for all
believers, not just those with certain titles or offices.



I have also got some questions around the Lord’s supper (the ‘love feast’
or ‘agape feast’ of Jude 12), around communal/intercessory prayer, and on
Christian community in general. The final chapter of Life Together is entitled,
‘Confession and the Lord’s Supper’.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION TO THE ENGLISH EDITION



A great introduction by Geffrey B. Kelly, it added a lot of context I didn’t
know about Bonhoeffer’s life and theology, but it also raised a lot of
questions. I won’t be able to draw any concrete conclusions of my own as to
what Bonhoeffer thought on any given topic, but I can still learn from what I
read, it can still give me some understanding.

> to voice his conviction that the worldwide church itself needed to promote a
> sense of community like this if it was to have new life breathed into it[^3]

[^3]: Page 3

We are always talking about breathing new life into the church. Maybe this would
be Bonhoeffer’s conclusion, that new life needs to be breathed into it, but I
wonder whether he would say we just need to recognise and rely on the life
that’s already there.

LIFE TOGETHER AND THE CRISES OF 1938



I didn’t highlight anything in this chapter, but it brought home to me just
how serious things were for true Christians at this time. Do we have any
comparable issues today?

### The Foundations of Bonhoeffer&rsquo;s Idea of Christian Community

> The Foundations of Bonhoeffer’s Idea of Christian Community[^5]

[^5]: Page 6

THE FOUNDATIONS OF BONHOEFFER’S IDEA OF CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY

> He claimed in that first foundational study that “God’s will is ever
> directed to the concrete historical human being.” In short, the will of God
> is expressed in a tangible word spoken to specific human beings and their
> communities. God’s “will” should never be allowed to die the death of
> abstraction through its institutional, dogmatic, or biblicist reductionism.[^6]

[^6]: Page 6

Earlier it says, ‘He was guided … by the questions of how God in Christ
becomes present in and among those who profess faith in the gospel.’ This is a
question I have too and I suspect it’s quite a common one. The foundational
study being referred to here is Communion of Saints, Bonhoeffer’s treatise on
the church.



This sentence is a mouthful: ‘God’s “will” should never … die the
death of abstraction through its institutional, dogmatic, or biblicist
reductionism.’ What does it mean? I looked up ‘reductionism’, and didn’t
learn anything immediately obvious. To ‘abstract’ something is to make it
less direct, further away, less concrete, practical, vibrant, personal, etc. For
something to ‘die the death of abstraction’, then, could be that its
personal, immediate, direct, living character is minimised in favour of
something else. In that case, perhaps Kelly is referring to the idea that people
let institution, dogma and types of biblical interpretation get in the way of
God’s ‘tangible word spoken to specific human beings and their
communities’. This may or may not become clearer as I continue to read Life
Together.

> The expression emanated from a deeply held conviction that Christian community
> had to integrate the gospel into its daily life and reflect this to the world.
> “Christ existing as community” challenges believers to behave as Christ to
> one another; this same Christ promises those who gather in his name to be
> present in, with, and for them.[^7]

[^7]: Page 7

Just before this excerpt, Keller notes that Bonhoeffer’s Sanctorum Communio
defines the church as ‘Christ existing as community’ and that ‘this was
more than a theological device’, but (in this excerpt), a ‘deeply held
conviction’. Bonhoeffer had the same thoughts as many before and after him:
the gospel must be part of the church’s daily life and this is what we must
reflect to the world. He’s wrestling with the question we saw before: ‘how
God in Christ becomes present in and among those who profess faith in the
gospel’.

> His immersion in these projects yielded for him the conceptual grist for
> setting in motion a new way of being the church.[^8]

[^8]: Page 7

Perhaps it was new to Bonhoeffer, to the Confessing Church, but nothing I’ve
read leads me to believe it was an entirely new way of being the church.

> At the inner core of the Christology that emerges from the Berlin
> dissertations is God’s Word present in the human being Jesus and in the
> community of those with whom Christ identifies. Life Together never strays
> from this form of Christocentrism.[^9]

[^9]: Page 8

Again, we visit the question of what it means for Christ to dwell in the church.
It also ties in with the discussion of abstracting away the will of God. If
God’s Word is present in the church (and it is living and active as we are
told in Hebrews 4:12; logos, the same word as in John 1:1, though I’m not sure
how much that means), then we ought to be able to discern his will and apply it
to whatever situations we find ourselves in. I found it interesting that Kelly
didn’t mention God’s Word being present in individual Christians, but ‘in
the community of those with whom Christ identifies’; it’s not even in the
community of those who identify with Christ, but those with whom Christ
identifies. It may not be worth making a big deal about, but the idea of the
corporate indwelling of Christ vs the individual indwelling of Christ is
something I’ve been thinking about recently.

> Christ is depicted as the embodiment both of God and Christians, who are moved
> to do what, without Christ, they would be unable to accomplish: to live
> together, sharing faith, hope, and self-giving love in a prayerful,
> compassionate, caring community.[^10]

[^10]: Page 8

This feels like one answer to the question we’ve been tracking. What does it
mean for Christ to dwell in the church? It means members of the church are moved
to do what they would otherwise be unable to do: ‘to live together, sharing
faith, hope and self-giving love in a prayerful, compassionate, caring
community’. That sounds pretty amazing to me. Naturally, as we get stuck into
the actual contents of the book, we’ll read more about this, but the
‘self-giving love’ becomes particularly important. I think I’ve had
glimpses of this sort of a community throughout my Christian life.

> The Christ of Life Together is the binding force of that community in its
> “togetherness,” gracing Christians to go beyond the superficial, often
> self-centered, relationships of their everyday associations toward a more
> intimate sense of what it means to be Christ to others, to love others as
> Christ has loved them.[^11]

[^11]: Page 8



> Bonhoeffer’s entire approach to the community life experienced at
> Finkenwalde depends on a strong faith in the vicarious action of Christ in
> Word, sacrament, intercessory prayer, and service that makes it possible for
> Christians to be both “with one another” [miteinander] and “for one
> another” [füreinander].[^12]

[^12]: Page 8

This is a particularly interesting teaser. The ‘vicarious action of Christ’
– I would love to see Christ operating through me more. What does he mean by
‘Word’? Is it spending time in the Bible? Does it look like spending time in
the Bible but actually go a lot deeper than that and involve a real meeting with
the ‘Word’? I am keen to understand these four things: Word, sacrament,
intercessory prayer and service. Maybe there are some things we’re missing in
our community?

> Bonhoeffer was unable to hide his aversion for attempts to etherialize the
> church into structures of empty ritual and perfunctory services that merely
> fronted for what purported to be an essentially “invisible heavenly
> reality.”[^13]

[^13]: Page 9

There’s a lot in this one. At this stage, I cannot know precisely what
Bonhoeffer was railing against. Here’s my guess: churches where Christians are
simply performing the ritual, where ‘worship’ becomes a thing (similar to
what we see in Amos and various other places) that has no
visible/experiential/practical impact on the ‘worshipper’, the type of faux
inner devotion to the Lord Jesus that doesn’t result in heart change, where we
no longer believe Jesus can and wants to be with us and lead us through our
lives in a personal way, where we just say the prayers or go through the motions
but we don’t experience Christ’s real presence in our churches. In case
anyone thinks I’m sitting here throwing stones at others, I know this to be a
feature of my own life. It’s not even something just from the past, it’s a
trap I often fall into. Part of the reason this book excites me so much is that
I am expecting to see some things I really need to see.

[^15]: Page 10

I would really love to spend weekends going to the country to ‘talk
theology’, to practice spiritual exercises, to have long walks, to listen to
music. Oh man, that just sounds amazing.

> The church, he insists in these lectures, is not called to be a tiny, sacred
> haven from the world but, like Jesus, a presence in the midst of the world[^16]

[^16]: Page 10

I’ve never heard anyone disagree with this, but I’m not quite sure what to
do with it. We talk about ‘bringing people to church’ which, in light of
this, feels wrong, but can’t totally be wrong because we’re told our love
will be the way people know we’re Jesus’ disciples (John 13:35). At some
level, having people observe the way we love one another should point them to
Jesus. How does a church like mine be a presence in the midst of the world? Not
just how do individual Christians do it, but how does our community have a
presence in the world?

> But in its visibility this church was to be neither a church of privilege nor
> a church totally absorbed into the secularism of the day. It was destined to
> be, instead, the community of Jesus Christ that is within the world, yet free
> enough from the world to oppose secular idolatries and to do the courageous
> deeds required in serving others.[^17]

[^17]: Page 11

This is one of those balancing acts churches are obliged to perform. As with the
previous quote, we ought not to have ‘sacred havens from the world’, places
where we strictly enforce conformity, where we avoid acknowledging sin. But we
also need to avoid being ‘totally absorbed into the secularism of the day’.
Now this is very different in our time than in Bonhoeffer’s – we’re not
dealing with the rise of such an obvious and immediate evil as the Nazis – but
there is still a balance to walk between retreating into sacred havens (that the
Nazis didn’t leave untouched for long) and being ‘totally absorbed’ by
what the world is driven by. I hesitate to discuss this (perhaps I shouldn’t
hesitate?) but I think there is a danger of us becoming absorbed by certain
arguments in the sphere of ‘identity politics’ (I’m not even sure this is
the correct term to use). We have a simple message, we don’t need to increase
the suffering of others, but nor do we need to allow those outside the church to
dictate to us what we ought to believe.



It seems to me that each person is morally responsible for what they believe
and, since Christians believe there is a God, we take that responsibility
seriously. Allowing society to teach us is good (since we have been blind and
there is biblical precedent for this as I touched on in my post on Amos 3:
https://oconal.id.au/2019/04/30/amos-3.html#iii2-falling-out-of-gods-favour) and
I can see the value of being a church that speaks to people’s hearts, but our
essential message, our gospel is ‘the announcement of God’s inbreaking
kingdom’ [Tom Wright, Paul for Everyone: The Prison Letters: Ephesians,
Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon (London: Society for Promoting Christian
Knowledge, 2004), 215]. It’s one of the things in my mind while I’m writing
this blog: I’m not writing for non-Christians, but for Christians.

> Real worldliness consists in the church’s being able to renounce all
> privileges and all its property but never Christ’s Word and the forgiveness
> of sins. With Christ and the forgiveness of sins to fall back on, the church
> is free to give up everything else.[^18]

[^18]: Page 11

This must have felt very poignant to Bonhoeffer. Apparently, Finkenwalde
(Bonhoeffer’s seminary) was shut down by the Gestapo just 2 years after it
started. He wrote Life Together in just four weeks because he thought (I think
rightly) that he’d not get another chance. When Kelly writes about ‘real
worldliness’, he is I think talking about Godly worldliness, i.e., the type of
worldliness God wants for his church.



It is not so terrifying or imminent for us today, but I can’t help but think
of the amount effort put in (and, at times, evil done) in the name of preserving
respect (‘privilege’) and saving money (‘property’) in the wake of the
child sexual abuse crisis that has hit various churches in the recent years. We
haven’t responded well to the allegations and some of the allegations show
just how far we’ve been willing to go to defend our privilege and property in
the past. We gave up ‘Christ’s Word’ when we didn’t defend the
defenceless in our churches.



Another example that comes to mind is the church’s tax exempt status in
Australia. I’m not sure if the discussion is ongoing, but I recall reading a
few articles defending the exemption. Certainly, you could make an argument that
if you are not asked to pay tax you need not force the issue, but what would we
be willing to give up to keep the privilege? I have been thinking a lot about
church finances and property and, like Bonhoeffer, believe that we must be
‘able to renounce’ it all but remain loyal to our king.

### The Community of Finkenwalde

THE COMMUNITY OF FINKENWALDE

[^20]: Page 12

Reading this sent shivers down my spine. Students being excluded from exams
unless they were Aryan? I’m sure similar things have happened in the past.
I’m glad Bonhoeffer stood against it. I’m devastated that a single Christian
was willing to go along with it. I hope I will live up to my expectations if
I’m ever faced with a similar situation.

[^21]: Page 12

This shows something really beautiful in Bonhoeffer’s heart. Gandhi wasn’t a
Christian, he wasn’t really any part of Bonhoeffer’s world (Bonhoeffer
needed a letter of introduction, so at least he hadn’t met Gandhi before), but
he was still eager to learn from him. Bonhoeffer seems like someone from whom I
can learn a lot.

[^22]: Page 12

Bonhoeffer was focused on training seminarians – there’s nothing wrong with
this – but I wonder should this same type of thinking be applied to the
Christian life? What if we took the message of Christ and the discipleship of
the Christian so seriously that all new Christians took a period of time devoted
to ‘pure doctrine, the Sermon on the Mount, and worship’? In many
situations, it would be insurmountably impractical. People often need to work to
take care of others. Is there some modification of this idea that would work? Is
this what our churches are trying to provide? I like the idea of it being
something more intense at the beginning of your Christian ministry, something
from which you graduate.

[^23]: Page 13

I’ll be honest here: I have to fight against jealousy when I read this. It
sounds so good! Later, Bonhoeffer talks about how unhelpful such jealousy is,
but I thought I’d throw it in here as a bit of a confession.

[^25]: Page 14

It is good for me to hear that these problems happen even in seminaries with
Bonhoeffer in charge! Christian community isn’t the unwavering success we’re
sometimes led to believe that it is, it’s hard, people don’t always see eye
to eye.

> surprised them and, for some, even stirred up resentment, since it was not
> considered the “Protestant” thing to do.[^26]

[^26]: Page 16

This is such an interesting story. I’ve often wondered about the confession of
sins in James 5:16 (‘Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for
each other so that you may be healed.’). I have also wondered what Paul was
writing about in 1 Corinthians 11:27 (‘So then, whoever eats the bread or
drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning
against the body and blood of the Lord.’). I’ve heard a few things about the
1 Corinthians passage (I don’t remember any of them clearly) that give me
pause before relating that directly to confession (I’m not sure if that’s
what Bonhoeffer did in his theology or not). Nevertheless, the verse in James
(and there may be more) means as ‘Protestants’ we should at least be
sometimes confessing our sins to one another.



Confession of sins to another person is something that I expect would be
unfamiliar to most protestants. In my context, I wonder whether people would
want to confess sins to people of the other gender. One of the things that I
thought of immediately was in the realm of lust and sexual sin. I’m quite
comfortable confessing these things to other men since I know they have likely
struggled with it at some point as well. But that thinking betrays what I’m
really doing, right? I’m looking for my sin to be excused. I’m afraid that
if I confess those things to someone who hasn’t struggled with it, I won’t
be understood when really I know that, even if they don’t understand me, Jesus
is among us and he does understand. An interesting train of thought for another
day.

[^27]: Page 16

I find the idea of introducing confession in our communities very attractive.
And this talks about the outcome of doing it well: ‘the atmosphere changed,
without in any way becoming inquisitorial’.



(Perhaps we do need to discriminate with what confessions we make to different
people. But I don’t think we should limit it to only certain groups. If we are
truly to have a community where we love and understand one another, it involves
acknowledging our sin to one another without unnecessary segregation.)

> Bonhoeffer did set two conditions to the practice. First, only those who
> themselves practice confession of sins should act as confessors of another.
> Second, those engaged in the practice should not regard it as part of a pious
> act or routine. The essence of the confession of sins lay in the promise of
> forgiveness in Christ.[^28]

[^28]: Page 17

It is fairly clear to me that if you have one group of people confessing to
another group of people (e.g., laypeople to pastors or priests) and it only ever
goes in that direction, you’ll start to mess with the non-hierarchical,
mutual, servant-leadership nature of Jesus’ church. In the previous quote we
saw Bonhoeffer confessing to one of the seminarians but it was described as an
outlier, as an odd thing done to make a point. Perhaps that wasn’t
Bonhoeffer’s motivation, but in my context I wouldn’t want things to work
like that. Bonhoeffer’s conditions here move things in a good direction.
Definitely something I’ll give more thought to.

[^31]: Page 18

The first point here, ‘that a community … added strength and objectivity to
preaching the Word’, is interesting. I’m not quite sure what it means?



‘Christian life … can never be lived in the abstract’ – I completely
agree with this. I’ve tried and failed to do it. One of the things I’ve
learnt about myself is how narrow my comfort zone is. For whatever reason, I
don’t seem to have a high threshold for discomfort. This has made living with
other people quite difficult. I’m also single which means I have to think and
make decisions about where and with whom I live. A big part of me always pulls
in the direction of living alone. There is no doubt in my mind that I would be
happier (as though that is the goal) and it’s something I seriously consider
every now and then. But when you live alone you don’t get as many
opportunities to be selfless, not by a long shot. You don’t get to practice
the most fundamental of Christian virtues: love. You actually miss opportunities
to be how God made us to be, to love others. I don’t have any
one-size-fits-all pronouncement of the ‘right’ way to live the Christian
life (far from it, I can see situations where it makes sense for someone to live
alone) but I really believe it’s one of those things that’s hard but also
extremely valuable. It shouldn’t simply be a function of whether or not you
can afford it, but of whether it helps or hinders your pursuit of life in Jesus.

[^36]: Page 27

I’ve mentioned jealousy a in my notes on Introduction to the English Edition
and Bonhoeffer doesn’t waste any time in putting me in my place (and rightly
so). Like I said before, I would love to be spending weekends in the country
chatting about theology with other like-minded individuals, I’d love to live
in a community with a bunch of other Christians who met regularly throughout the
day for prayer. It is something I sometimes ask God for. But I cannot be in the
place where I take the community God has given me for granted.



I recently went on a trip to New York City for work. I don’t really enjoy
travel, it’s just not for me. I do, however, absolutely love spending time
hanging out with people. I had three weeks in NYC; another colleague from
Australia was there with me in the first week, after which he went back home. I
was lonelier then than I’ve been in a long time. I realised anew just how
blessed I was and how beautiful my community was back in Adelaide. When I got
off the plane in Adelaide, it really did feel like a homecoming. A couple of
days later when I saw my brothers and sisters, I felt an overwhelming sense of
gratitude to God. I felt it the next time I saw them a couple of days later. I
was reminded just how much I saw Jesus when I spent time with them. But then
gradually it wore off and I fell into this exact trap: I took ‘the privilege
of living among other Christians’ for granted.

> around God’s word and sacrament in this world. Not all Christians partake of
> this grace. The imprisoned, the sick, the lonely who live in the diaspora, the
> proclaimers of the gospel in heathen lands stand alone.[^37]

[^37]: Page 28

This is so true yet I forget it all the time. I have a friend who often thanks
God for this when he prays and every time he does I’m surprised by how quickly
I’ve forgotten what a privilege it is. And, Bonhoeffer’s audience, the ones
he’s reminding, were living under Nazi rule when things were really heating up
for true Christians.

> The physical presence of other Christians is a source of incomparable joy and
> strength to the believer[^38]

[^38]: Page 29

One of the things I have always struggled with is the word ‘joy’. What does
it mean? But regardless of that, I can see how true this statement is, what
immense value other believers have.

> The believer need not feel any shame when yearning for the physical presence
> of other Christians, as if one were still living too much in the flesh[^39]

[^39]: Page 29

This is a good thing to hear. For much of my life I’ve felt quite lonely, I
have yearned for companionship. God is gracious to me, he keeps me going. I have
felt as though for some reason I shouldn’t be so lonely, I shouldn’t be
craving something I don’t have, but I agree with Bonhoeffer, ‘the believer
need not feel any shame’ for this, it is a good thing, it is a natural thing.

[^43]: Page 30

This further attacks the jealousy I feel. God is the giver of gifts, he knows
what he’s doing.



My heart goes out to Christians whose only connection with fellow believers is a
letter. I wonder if there’s anyone I could be writing to to encourage them in
their faith?

[^44]: Page 31

Okay, we have a definition for ‘Christian community’: community (life
together) through Jesus and in Jesus. Initially, this seemed rather unhelpful a
definition to me. Even when Bonhoeffer goes on to ask and answer, ‘What does
this mean?’, I don’t feel like I get much insight. You can look up the
answers given, but they weren’t particularly helpful to me. However, things
did become clearer the further I read.

> First, Christians are persons who no longer seek their salvation, their
> deliverance, their justification in themselves, but in Jesus Christ alone[^45]

[^45]: Page 31

Bonhoeffer begins to unpack what it means to be a Christian. This seemed pretty
obvious to me at first, but after a few minutes staring at it trying to
understand, I saw why it’s such an important and powerful statement. To be in
Christian community, to be a Christian, I have to give up any ideas I have of
being able to save myself. And it’s something I have to keep doing because,
like a dog returning to its vomit, my gaze constantly slips from Christ, I keep
trying to save, deliver and justify myself.

When I am afraid of being wrong in front of other Christians (which usually
manifests by me defending an idea I had way too strongly), I am forgetting just
how fundamentally broken I am by sin (and how completely I’ve been forgiven).
When I try to do things to look good or to win points, I am forgetting just how
incapable I am of doing anything of value without Jesus, I’m forgetting how
much he’s done for me. This is so fundamental.

> themselves out of the truth.[^46]

[^46]: Page 32

This is one of my favourite quotes so far. It’s an old truth but one worth
repeating.

> Christ. In him, broken and divided humanity has become one.[^48]

[^48]: Page 32

Bonhoeffer is starting to flesh out what it means to be a community that gathers
around Christ. There’s something powerful in here that I need to think more
about: I come to others only through Jesus. As it says in Ephesians 2:14, ‘he
himself is our peace’.

> The more genuine and the deeper our community becomes, the more everything

[^49]: Page 34



> Those who want more than what Christ has established between us do not want
> Christian community. They are looking for some extraordinary experiences of
> community that were denied them elsewhere.[^50]

[^50]: Page 34

This is powerful and unpleasant. I think Bonhoeffer is talking about the times
when we try to have the community fulfil our own needs. He will go into this
further, but I had to pause when I read this because it seemed to speak directly
to my heart. I’ve seen it in myself and I’ve seen it in others, this pursuit
of community for its own sake instead of having anything to do with Jesus. My
reaction to conflict is evidence of this — when the community doesn’t
look or feel like I want it to, I find that I no longer enjoy it, no longer
think quite so fondly of it.

> durable Christian community. Sooner or later it is bound to collapse.[^51]

[^51]: Page 35

I’ve been in communities like this. I’ve been the one ‘clinging to [an]
idealized image.’ I’ve been one of the people who didn’t ‘survive such
disillusionment.’ And yes, it’s difficult to hear, but I. agree, it will
eventually collapse.



What is the idealised image that I bring with me? Well, it looks a lot like
https://medium.com/throughmylens/life-together-45daa1d55219#2f5c: lots of
prayer, theological discussion, lots of time spent together doing things I enjoy
(walks, listening to music, chatting), no demands put on me that I’m not
comfortable with, no opportunity for me to do or say the wrong thing.



Where does it go wrong? I want to make demands on others. I want commitment to
me instead of to Jesus. I want to be able to say to people that they’re not
living up to what they said they would (and I have done this in the past). If I
want a ‘durable Christian community,’ I need to do away with this idea.

[^53]: Page 36

I have been proud and pretentious. I’ve criticised others for not doing the
things I thought we should be doing. I have entered with ‘demands,’ ‘set
up [my] own law,’ and ‘judged [others]’ and, yes, ‘even God.’

[^55]: Page 36

Continuing on the theme of jealousy, I want what I do not have, I want what God
has not given me and I forget what God has done for me, I am an ungrateful
child.

[^56]: Page 37

I have felt such a lack of ‘deep certainty,’ of ‘strong faith,’ of
‘rich experiences.’ Recently, I was feeling particularly low while
discussing the idea of joy with some brothers and sisters. I listened to their
stories and I wished I had similar stories to share. I’ve always longed for
more experiences of God, more supernatural events in my life. Bonhoeffer says
this happens to Christians who are not thankful, which seems like it could be
true. It’s time for me to be more thankful.

> God from letting our community grow according to the measure and riches that

[^57]: Page 37

I think Bonhoeffer’s words would ring true for most Christians who’ve been
in a Christian community. We’ve all been in communities where there are ‘no
great experiences, no noticeable riches’ but instead where there is ‘much
weakness, difficulty, and little faith’. What should we do in this situation?
We should thank God for the gift of such a community. I’ve often wondered
whether it is possible to hinder God, but of course it is. If God has truly
decided to partner with us, if God’s way of operating in our lives is with our
consent and active participation, then of course we can get in the way of it.

[^58]: Page 37

This passage belies Bonhoeffer’s audience: seminarians, but it applies equally
to those who aren’t called ‘pastors’ (pastoral care of other believers is,
I think, the responsibility of all Christians). I have made accusations against
communities, I don’t give it a second thought when it happens. I don’t look
at my vision of the community ‘to see whether the underlying problem [is my]
own idealized image’.

[^59]: Page 38

How true this is. Who am I to say what God is doing is ‘weak and
insignificant’? We do spend a lot of time ‘feeling the pulse’ or ‘taking
[the] temperature’ of our interior lives and our communities. It seems good,
right? Why wouldn’t we want to be constantly improving? Or learning? Or
growing? There is value in periods of reflection, but we don’t need to be
always reflecting, always looking for ways to improve (for me, this means,
always criticising). Maybe the default and most common setting for our Christian
lives should be peaceful striving? Constantly dying to self, battling against
sin, overcoming evil with good, etc., but not constantly looking for issues.

> Christian community is not an ideal we have to realize, but rather a reality
> created by God in Christ in which we may participate[^60]

[^60]: Page 38

This is powerful. I think I get what it means, but I’m not sure how to do it.
It’s related to the previous point, right? Paul doesn’t tell us to create
unity, but to maintain the unity of the Spirit (‘make every effort to keep the
unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace’, Ephesians 4:3). After this,
Paul talks about what we have in common as Christians, ‘There is one body and
one Spirit … one hope … one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and
Father’ (Ephesians 4:4–5). I have a lot to learn here.

> The Scriptures call pneumatic or “spiritual” [geistlich] what is created
> only by the Holy Spirit, who puts Jesus Christ into our hearts as lord and
> savior. The scriptures call psychic or emotional [seelisch] what comes from
> the natural urges, strengths, and abilities of the human soul.[^61]

[^61]: Page 38

Bonhoeffer talks a bit about the difference between ‘spiritual’ and
‘emotional’ motivation. He says they are at odds with each other. This
definition (‘spiritual’ being ‘what is created only by the Holy Spirit’;
‘emotional’ being ‘what comes from the natural urges’) is helpful in
understanding some of the following excerpts.

> The basis of spiritual community is truth; the basis of emotional community is
> desire. The essence of spiritual community is light. For “God is light and
> in [God] there is no darkness at all” (1 John 1:5); and “if we walk in the
> light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another” (1
> John 1:7). The essence of emotional, self-centered community is darkness,
> “for it is from within, from the human heart, that evil intentions come”
> (Mark 7:21).[^62]

[^62]: Page 39

I’m not sure if there is a significant difference in Bonhoeffer’s mind
between ‘basis’ and ‘essence’, but my takeaway from this is that
‘truth’ and ‘light’ are the same thing. Not the truth we sometimes talk
about, not facts or doctrine, but the truth that enlightens our hearts and
minds, the truth that (when we see it) captures our vision, the truth that
purifies our desires. I think this is borne out in some of the following
excerpts, but I’m still digesting this one, struggling to grasp it.

> In the spiritual community the Word of God alone rules; in the emotional,
> self-centered community the individual who is equipped with exceptional
> powers, experience, and magical, suggestive abilities rules along with the
> Word[^63]

[^63]: Page 40

In the same way that truth isn’t doctrine or facts, the Word of God in
Bonhoeffer’s usage isn’t simply the Bible, it is the living person of Jesus
present in the Bible, it is the living person of Jesus present in other
Christians, it is intricately linked to the Spirit’s work in conforming us to
the image of Jesus.



The community that I’m part of is taking some time right now to look at what
it means to be centred around and led by King Jesus (i.e., what it means to be a
‘church’). This description of a self-centred community where gifted people
(perhaps called ‘pastors’ or ‘ministers’) ‘[rule] along with the
Word’ is familiar to us and something we are keenly trying to avoid. We
succeed more at some times than others.



I think one example of this is very common in churches: when the Scriptures are
read, a gifted person (a good speaker, an intelligent person, a scholar, a
thinker, a more spiritual person, etc.) then explains it. I am, of course,
talking about preaching. Now, I’m sure Bonhoeffer would have been in favour of
preaching and I’m in favour of it too, but if it’s the primary way we
interact with Scripture (perhaps measured by time spent), then we are (I think)
saying two things:



- - 


This is a much larger topic than I can go into here, but I wonder whether this
is what Paul was warning us against in 1 Thessalonians when he wrote, ‘Do not
quench the Spirit’ (5:19). The Word of God alone must rule in our communities.

> So far as these are devout people, they certainly seek this power with the
> intention of serving the highest and the best. But in reality they end up
> dethroning the Holy Spirit and banishing it to the realm of unreal remoteness;
> only what is self-centered remains real here.[^64]

[^64]: Page 40



> However, in the self-centered community there exists a profound, elemental
> emotional desire for community, for immediate contact with other human souls,
> just as in the flesh there is a yearning for immediate union with other flesh[^65]

[^65]: Page 41

This was a hard one for me to come at. I do have a ‘profound, elemental
emotional desire for community’, I long for ‘immediate contact with other
human souls’. I don’t think Bonhoeffer is saying this is inherently evil. On
the contrary, I think it is something God has placed in us. What I think he is
saying is that this cannot be the basis for our communities. We cannot be Christ
to one another if we are out to satisfy our desires. Christ is not self-centred.



It would be false to pretend I don’t have desires, but if I go to the
community to satisfy my desires instead of to gather around Christ, to be led by
him, to show him to others, to worship him, then I am missing the whole point
and I won’t get what I need.

[^67]: Page 42

An interesting observation about a danger that is all too real in the church:
people committed to the community (or to a member of the community, usually a
leader) instead of to Jesus. We see this when groups stop meeting if the
‘leader’ isn’t present. We see this when people’s faith is broken beyond
repair when their leaders’ failures are exposed. We see this when, after
gathering, people spend all their time talking about how good the preaching was,
or how good the music was.

[^70]: Page 43

What does Bonhoeffer mean when he talks about a ‘false’ community? He’s
talking about the self-centred instead of Christ-centred communities. He’s
talking about communities where the Holy Spirit is shut out in favour of our
rituals, our personalities, our programs. I’ve been part of false communities.
It’s hard to know whether to fight to fix a community or to allow it to be
dissolved. It’s also hard to have these conversations in certain situations
where the leaders are far removed from the individuals.

[^71]: Page 43

Another awesome quote that I’m not quite sure of the meaning of. I get that
spiritual love comes from Jesus. I get that it serves him alone (in the case of
community, out of love for his church/people/bride). The idea that ‘[spiritual
love] has no direct access to other persons’ resonates with me in a way that I
can’t quite put my finger on. Is it related to unity? Is it that I have no
unity with another person except through Christ? That, when I interact with
other Christians, I must do so through Christ?

[^74]: Page 43

Similar to a previous excerpt, this resonates with me. I think Bonhoeffer is
talking about Christ mediating through practices such as intercessory prayer,
Bible reading, singing, sharing the Lord’s supper. That makes sense, right?
Our relationships with other believers are based on our mutual love of Christ,
are made possible because of Christ. We are united in the Spirit, so shouldn’t
we be having the Spirit as a major part of our relationships?

[^77]: Page 44

This is a truth I need to grab hold of. I read a lot, I think a lot, I talk a
lot, but I don’t often trust Jesus to deal with other people. I act like
it’s all up to me.

[^78]: Page 44

Another lesson for me. I love the way he puts it, ‘[spiritual love] knows that
the most direct way to others is always through prayer to Christ’.

[^79]: Page 45

This is something I have thought a lot about. I am not interested in starting a
movement. I’m not interested in being remembered. Whatever community I am part
of is, as Bonhoeffer wrote, ‘part of the one, holy, universal, Christian
church, sharing … the hardships and struggles and promise of the whole
church’. I have seen (usually from the outside, but sometimes from the inside)
so many great expressions of Jesus’ church collapse when they started being
expanding into ‘movements’.

[^81]: Page 45

This is something I’ve seen, it’s something that’s happened to me, it’s
something I’ve done to others. What a great reminder: by excluding others we
may be excluding Christ.

[^82]: Page 46

This is another good warning that needs to be unpacked. We can’t go too far
down the ‘purely spiritual life’ path because it’s not natural. Family,
work, everyday life must be part of our spiritual community.

[^83]: Page 47

A great note to end the chapter on: 'we are bound together by faith, not by
experience’.

THE DAY TOGETHER

## The Day Together

> Life together under the Word begins at an early hour of the day with a worship

[^85]: Page 51

This is similar to the ancient monastic practice of rising early and having the
first words that cross one’s lips be ‘Domine, labia mea aperies, et os meum
annuntiabit laudem tuam’, or in English, ‘Lord, open our lips, and we shall
praise your name’ (taken from the present form of the Roman catholic Divine
Office). It is a beautiful practice. I’ve no idea who said it, but I’ve
heard a quote something along the lines of ‘If you want to be a radical
Christian, don’t pick up your phone first thing in the morning, read a psalm
instead.’ It is a good thing for the first words you utter each day to be to
God. I have done this myself at times in my life but, as I often do, I have
allowed this practice to lapse. It’s time to get it going again.

> heart to rise early to seek the Lord who made him, and to petition the Most

[^86]: Page 51

Bonhoeffer refers to Scripture throughout this chapter as the authority behind
his conclusions, but I was surprised to see a reference to ‘Jesus Ben
Sirach,’ which is called either ‘Sirach’ or ‘Ecclesiasticus’ and is an
apocryphal (or deuterocanonical) book. I have some opinions on the use of
apocryphal books and I do not dispute that they have value, I was just surprised
to see such a staunchly reformed thinker as Bonhoeffer quoting one.

> For Christians the beginning of the day should not be burdened and haunted by
> the various kinds of concerns they face during the working day[^87]

[^87]: Page 51

This is an interesting one and there is something for me to learn here.
Sometimes I take meetings quite early in the day (usually the earliest is about
6.30 am). When this happens, I set my alarm for 6.15 (I work from home) and I
wake up with just enough time to grab a coffee, throw some clothes on and get to
the meeting. I then proceed to continue working for the rest of the day and
don’t bother to come back to my normal morning ritual, which includes some
time before the Lord. I think this needs to change, that either I need to be
prepared and able to wake up at 5.15 am or I need to say no to those
early-morning meetings.

> But there is such a thing as rising early for the love of God. That was the
> practice of the men of the Holy Scriptures.[^88]

[^88]: Page 52

Bonhoeffer lists Scriptures that show how the certain biblical figures rose
early to accomplish what God told them to do, that is, they rose early ‘for
the love of God’: Abraham (‘Early the next morning Abraham got up and
returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD,’ Genesis 19:27; cf.
22:3), Jacob, Moses (‘Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the
morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river …,”’ Exodus 8:20;
cf. 9:13, 24:4) and Joshua (‘Early in the morning Joshua and all the
Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan, where they camped before
crossing over,’ Joshua 3:1; cf 6:12). This is a good reminder that we ought to
rise early not so that we can have an easy morning necessarily (though that is
not a bad thing), but because we love God.



He also talked about those who get up early in vain who, as the Psalmist says,
end up ‘eating [their] bread with tears.’ This ties in with what Bonhoeffer
wrote about not allowing the concerns of the day become the focus of our morning
worship and it highlights how much I miss the mark when I get up and start
working immediately.

This intrigues me. I have tried a few daily office liturgies over the years.
I’ve used the 1970 Catholic Divine Office (also known as the
https://www.catholic.org.au/liturgy-of-the-hours-prayer-of-the-church-resources,
a version of which is https://universalis.com/), the Church of England’s
https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-and-worship/join-us-daily-prayer (and its
Franciscan version, http://www.oremus.org/liturgy/ccp/), the Anglican Church of
Australia’s https://www.garrattpublishing.com.au/product/9781920892210/, the
archaic but in some ways uniquely beautiful https://www.anglicanbreviary.net/,
and the contemporary non-denominational http://commonprayer.net/. There are, of
course, many other daily office liturgies out there. All the ones I’ve tried
have one thing in common: the Psalms play a big part. This is, I think, what
keeps drawing me back to them. The Psalms are important as is praying them
together as a community.



Bonhoeffer remarked that ‘the practice [of praying the Psalms together] has
been lost to a large extent’ and that seems true today, but I see lots of
promising signs that the church is realising just how valuable they are.

> praying here, and not only here, but in the whole Psalter.[^91]

[^91]: Page 54

Bonhoeffer introduces this idea that the psalms are Jesus’ prayer, which he
continues to develop later in this chapter. When he refers to certain psalms
that ‘make us falter and offend us’, he is referring to the so-called
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprecatory_Psalms. One example is found in Psalm
69: ‘May the table set before them become a snare; may it become retribution
and a trap’ (69:22; the psalmist continues in this vain until verse 28). These
psalms don’t naturally sit well with us (they seem to contradict Jesus’
command to love our enemies, cf. Matthew 5:43ff) and Bonhoeffer’s answer is
that we aren’t necessarily the primary prayer, we are joining the prayer of
someone who is much greater than us, the Lord Jesus Christ.



It’s definitely an interesting idea and it does help me pray some of the
psalms more honestly, but I’m not yet convinced that it is totally correct.
Later, Bonhoeffer adds to this, saying that the individual Christian joins his
community, the community joins the whole church and the whole church prays along
with Jesus.

> The Psalter is the prayer book of Jesus Christ in the truest sense of the
> word. He prayed the Psalter, and now it has become his prayer for all time.[^92]

[^92]: Page 54

I do not doubt that Jesus prayed the psalms while he was here on earth, but does
he pray them still? Consider, for example, the famous words in Psalm 22:1, ‘My
God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far
from my cries of anguish?’ I cannot imagine Jesus praying this for himself,
nor can I imagine Jesus praying this for his body on earth (the church), for it
is not true that God has forsaken the church. On the contrary, God sent his Son
for us, God has given us the Holy Spirit to us, we are far from forsaken. I can,
on the other hand, imagine praying that for myself because I forget how untrue
it is that God has forsaken me; I can imagine praying that for the church
because I forget how impossible it is for God to forsake his church.



But there might be a deeper meaning to uncover here. Jesus and his church are
inseparable, it is body, he is its head, one cannot separate the head from the
body and still have something living at the end. Jesus suffers along with his
church, he prays along with us and we pray along with him. Our prayer is his
prayer and his prayer is our prayer. Or at least I’m open to seeing something
like that.

> on this basis. Because Christ prays the prayer of the Psalms with the

> because those who pray the Psalms are joining in the prayer of Jesus Christ,
> their prayer reaches the ears of God. Christ has become their intercessor.[^93]

[^93]: Page 55

But there might be a deeper meaning to uncover here. Jesus and his church are
inseparable, it is body, he is its head, one cannot separate the head from the
body and still have something living at the end. Jesus suffers along with his
church, he prays along with us and we pray along with him. Our prayer is his
prayer and his prayer is our prayer. This seems to be what Bonhoeffer is saying
here.



It also lines up with what we read in the Bible that we now have access to the
Father through Jesus (‘For through him we both have access to the Father by
one Spirit’, Ephesians 2:18). In Romans, Paul tells us that Jesus intercedes
for us: ‘Christ Jesus who died … is at the right hand of God and is also
interceding for us’ (Romans 8:34). So the view is that we are praying with
Jesus because he is praying for us, we pray through Jesus. I am seeing a glimmer
of understanding.

> The Psalter is the vicarious prayer of Christ for his congregation.[^94]

[^94]: Page 55

[^95]: Page 55

[^96]: Page 55

> is the great school of prayer. First, we learn here what prayer means: it

[^97]: Page 55

Bonhoeffer shares several things we learn from the psalms. They show us how to
pray, he says. I was left wondering how the Lord’s Prayer fit into this.
Nevertheless, these are good points and I’ve found them to be useful to me:
(1) prayer is informed by the Word of God, our prayers should be based on the
promises we find there.

> Second, we learn from the prayer of the Psalms what we should pray. As certain
> as it is that the prayer of the Psalms ranges far beyond the experiences of

> of Christ, the prayer of one who was truly human and who alone possesses the
> full range of experiences expressed in these prayers.[^98]

[^98]: Page 56

We learn what we should pray. The psalms have been so comforting to me
throughout my Christian life, they’ve given me permission to share my
innermost longings, my darkest thoughts with my Father; they’ve put me back on
the right track by reminding me to praise and be thankful to my Father. There is
no doubt in my mind that Jesus experienced the full range of human misery and
human joy.

> Can we, then, pray the psalms of vengeance? Insofar as we are sinners and
> associate evil thoughts with the prayer of vengeance, we must not do so. But

> of God, who was in this way stricken by the wrath of God and in no other way
> could forgive his enemies, and who himself suffered this wrath so that his
> enemies might go free.[^99]

[^99]: Page 56

Bonhoeffer again expresses his own objections to the imprecatory psalms. I’m
not sure whether I agree with him. I agree that Jesus’ people do not harbour
‘evil thoughts.’ I also agree that we can pray these from the heart of Jesus
because in him our hearts are being renewed. I’m not convinced that Jesus took
God’s wrath on himself (gasp!). So I suppose I do agree with Bonhoeffer’s
conclusions, but not necessarily with his reasons.

> We can and we should pray the psalms of suffering, not to become completely
> caught up in something our heart does not know from its own experience, nor to
> make our own complaints, but because all this suffering was genuine and real
> in Jesus Christ[^100]

[^100]: Page 56

We can pray the psalms of suffering (e.g., Psalm 22) even though we haven’t
suffered as deeply as Jesus (or, for most of the people I met, even as deeply as
David) because we are pleading the case of our whole community and of the whole
church, and because we identify completely and totally with Jesus Christ who has
suffered these things.

> Third, the prayer of the Psalms teaches us to pray as a community. The body of

> tiny fraction of the whole prayer of the church. I learn to join the body of
> Christ in its prayer. That lifts me above my personal concerns and allows me
> to pray selflessly.[^101]

[^101]: Page 57

This is such a great point. Even though I highlighted it while I was reading, it
didn’t really hit me until I read it again in order to write my thoughts down.
When I am downhearted but I pray a joyful psalm, I am rejoicing with those who
rejoice; when I am elated but I pray a sorrowful psalm, I am mourning with those
who mourn (cf. Romans 12:15). It helps me to get beyond myself, to take my
prayer from being completely self-centred to being genuinely prayed for others.

[^102]: Page 57

The psalms often employ a literary form called ‘parallelism’ which the
Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary describes as ‘the repetition of the same or
related semantic content and/or grammatical structure in consecutive lines or
verses.’ Bonhoeffer doesn’t disagree with viewing this parallelism as a
literary form or device, but he sees a theological significance to it. He sees
this parallelism as evidence that the psalms were sung antiphonally, that is,
the first line was sung by one part of the congregation and the second part by
another part. Using his example of Psalm 5, we would have one group singing
‘Listen to my words, LORD’ and the other singing ‘consider my lament.’



Again, according to the Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary, parallelism is ‘the most
prominent rhetorical figure in ancient Near Eastern poetry, and is also present,
although less prominent, in biblical prose.’ As such, I have a hard time
drawing too deeply on its theological significance, though I’m sure Bonhoeffer
isn’t the only one to suggest this and perhaps, with more reading, I could be
convinced. Nevertheless, the psalms do lend themselves to antiphonal singing so
it is possible that they were used in that fashion. They were certainly sung
antiphonally throughout much of Christian history and still are today in many
churches and religious communities.

[^103]: Page 58

Bonhoeffer touches on my earlier question regarding the Lord’s Prayer. He
references a commentary on the psalms where they were categorised according to
the seven petitions of the Lord’s Prayer (I was unable to find this after a
short search). I agree with his point: with the psalms as our teacher, our
prayer will grow simpler and more rewarding the more we pray.

> [Hausgemeinde], is followed by a Scripture reading. “Give attention to the

[^104]: Page 58



> There can be no doubt that the daily Bible passages published by the Moravian
> Brethren, for example, are a real blessing to all who have ever used them.[^105]

[^105]: Page 58

Bonhoeffer here takes aim at a particular way of engaging with Scripture that
was common in his day and, in certain circles, is common in ours. He talks about
two things, first the Moravian Brethren’s ‘Daily Texts’ (called Losungen
der Brüdergemeine in German) and second something known as ‘Bread for
Today.’ He is clearly not against the Moravian texts in principal as, not only
does he praise them here, he refers to them extensively in his Letters and
Papers from Prison, but he is against the idea of a person’s only exposure to
the Bible being little extracts, verses pulled out of context and out of the
larger story that is being told. When I read the description of ‘Bread for
Today’ being ‘a well-known tear-off calendar’, I knew exactly what
Bonhoeffer was referring to.



Of course, I agree with Bonhoeffer’s assessment that reading (for a mature
believer), reading a little memory verse, engaging with only a small piece of
scripture is not enough to satisfy the Christian’s need for God’s Word. We
need to be squeezing whatever juice we can out of this most precious revelation
to us.



Bonhoeffer explains this well in the next extract I pulled out, but for now
I’d like to turn back to the
https://www.moravian.org/2018/07/using-the-moravian-daily-texts/. I was really
intrigued by them when I read about them, so I did a little research. They have
been published for 288 years without break (since 1731), they contain a Psalm,
Old Testament reading, New Testament reading, a short ‘watchword’ (likely
what Bonhoeffer was referring to when he included them in this section), verses
from hymns, a ‘doctrinal text’, and a concluding prayer. I’m not sure if
this was all included in the publications at Bonhoeffer’s time, but it is
today.



Here is an example of today’s:



Saturday, June 29 — Psalm 80:1–7

Isaiah 11:10–13:22; Galatians 6:6–18



I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, says the Lord. Jeremiah
21:14



Let me at thy throne of mercy

find a sweet relief;

kneeling there in deep contrition,

help my unbelief. (772)



So let us not grow weary in doing what is right, for we will reap at harvest
time, if we do not give up. Galatians 6:9



Take up your cross, and follow Christ,

nor think till death to lay it down;

for only those who bear the cross

may hope to wear the glorious crown. (758)



Gracious Lord, we confess those times when our work does not reflect our faith
in you. Sometimes, we give up because of our impatience to trust in your timing.
We fail to do what is pleasing in your sight because we are afraid of the
world’s reaction. Forgive, redeem, and renew us through your spirit [sic].
Amen.



I am always on the lookout for things like this so I picked up a copy and I’m
going to try it out for a while for my own personal prayer time and devotion.
It’s simple (the psalms and scriptures are read in order on the weekdays), it
doesn’t leave anything out (the whole Psalter is read in one year, the whole
Bible in two), it is historical (288 years isn’t long in the history of the
church, but it’s old enough for me). According to a note by the editor, these
texts are ‘considered the most widely read daily worship guide in the world
next to the Bible, every year approximately 1.25 million copies are published in
34 languages and dialects.’

[^111]: Page 60

Bonhoeffer’s ideas clearly met with some resistance. He is, of course,
correct. Christians who can read, have access to the Bible in their language,
are permitted the time to read and study it, but who do not feel at home within
its pages, are giving up a tremendous resource. I felt convicted when I read
these words. I feel like I know the Bible fairly well, I know it more and more
each day. I have read it through cover to cover at least twice (some books
I’ve read dozens of times), but I feel like I’m only scratching the surface.
If you threw me suddenly into the middle of a chapter in Jeremiah, for example,
I confess, I would find myself at a loss. But I am serious about being familiar
with the Scriptures and Bonhoeffer’s words are a good encouragement that it is
valuable and expected for a Christian in my position to be growing in his
understanding of the Bible.

> Because the Scripture is a corpus, a living whole, the so-called lectio

[^112]: Page 61

I’m not sure if this particular phrase has come up before, but when Bonhoeffer
says ‘house church,’ he is talking about a church made up of people who live
together, he’s not talking about a church that meets in a house, which is what
we would refer to as a ‘house church.’



https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YL-5Dp1XFI is popular in many churches for good
reason. It is an ancient practice and is basically the practice of reading (or
preaching) through either the entire Bible or at least an entire book of the
Bible consecutively. It brings out all the good things that Bonhoeffer is
talking about, it lets us into the story, it helps us understand the context,
it’s a great way of engaging with the Bible. As Bonhoeffer so eloquently says,
‘we receive a part of that which once took place for our salvation.’ We see
the church in national Israel, we see the life with God that is our destiny in
the promised land, we see our daily struggles in Israel’s unbelief and
repentance, we see God faithfully acting for the good of his people through
history.

[^113]: Page 62

[^114]: Page 62

I looked at this with confusion for a while when I first read it, but I finally
realised what a profound point Bonhoeffer was making: what God did in Jesus is
more important than what I will do for God today. I had to let that sink in, but
of course it is, what nonsense it would be were it any other way.

[^115]: Page 63

On of my favourite podcasts, https://nakedbiblepodcast.com, Mike Heiser says
something along the lines of, ‘If it’s not hard work, you’re not studying
the Bible.’ I consider myself a reasonably intelligent person, I like reading,
I like studying, but yeah, studying the Bible is hard work for me. But it is
also incredibly rewarding.



Now, everybody has different skills and I don’t believe we’re all called to
study the Bible in exactly the same ways (Dr Heiser will always know orders of
magnitude more than I about the Bible), but our communities must have people who
do study the Bible in really serious ways, we must be communities that talk
about it, that read it together, that share ideas and correct one another. If
our communities are able to make decisions on ‘church activity’ and if
we’re to help each other make decisions on ‘personal deeds,’ then we must
‘stand on solid biblical ground.’

[^117]: Page 63



> Perhaps we should ask a further question: How are we supposed to help rightly
> other Christians who are experiencing troubles and temptation [Anfechtung] if
> not with God’s own Word[^118]

[^118]: Page 63

Following on from my previous point, if we are to help each other, we must know
the Bible. There are many practical ways we can help our fellow Christians, but
if we are a Christ-centred community, then the primary (and most effective) way
of helping other Christians is through Christ, and one way this happens is
through Jesus in the Word.

> How should we read the Holy Scriptures? In a community living together it is
> best that its various members assume the task of consecutive reading by taking

[^119]: Page 63

This is an important point. It is something I think Bonhoeffer would say we get
mostly right. Most of the churches I’ve been to will have various community
members reading the Scriptures. However, I have seen this lead to feelings of
the Scripture readers being a special group of people. I think Bonhoeffer would
say that all community members (even, perhaps, those who don’t want to) should
be involved in reading the Scripture to the community. And, as we have
previously seen, Bonhoeffer would tell those who aren’t reading out loud to
have their Bibles open and be reading along in their head.

[^120]: Page 64

I have listened to people reading the Bible, I’ve listened to people talk
about their public Bible reading and, at times, I’ve gotten the impression
that they’ve fallen into one or more of the traps Bonhoeffer describes here.
But it’s a hard thing to pin down. The classic preacher we see in movies says
‘Thus saith the Lord’ but the way they deliver it, it’s as though
they’ve taken the position of God in pronouncing their audience to be sinners.
I get the same feeling when I encounter some street preachers. The difference
between a godly reading of Scripture and a sinful one is whether or not we
remember that the primary audience to whom we should be delivering this message
is our own hearts. Yes, we are speaking to others, but we are also reading
God’s words to ourselves.

[^123]: Page 66

This is such an important point. I’ve been part of churches where the music
seems more like a concert, performed for a human audience, than an expression of
the community’s heart of love for God. I’ve performed in these concerts,
I’ve had the wrong heart attitude myself. It becomes, as Bonhoeffer puts it,
‘the dreadful muddle of human self-praise.’ There is nothing wrong with
being a good musician, with pursuing excellence in that space, but when we’re
more worried that we’ve played or sung the right notes than whether we’re
truly worshipping God from our hearts, we’ve fallen into ‘human
self-praise.’

[^124]: Page 67

Given the human heart’s ability to turn what should be for God into something
for itself, I can imagine what Bonhoeffer’s motive in saying this might be,
but I don’t agree. Certainly, where the words are present, they are important,
but the music itself is also important. Perhaps Bonhoeffer wasn’t a musical
person, maybe his heart didn’t speak to God through music, but mine does and I
don’t think I’m the only one. Paul wrote that, ‘We do not know what we
ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless
groans’ (Romans 8:26). We don’t need to use words to worship God.

[^125]: Page 67

This is a lengthy quote and there is a lot in it. I’m not sure I agree with
Bonhoeffer that singing is where ‘vanity and bad taste’ are most likely to
be found. Maybe he’s had some particularly bad experiences, maybe it was a
serious issue in his church at the time, or the wider group of churches in his
area.



Bonhoeffer describes four scenarios, all of which I think can come from a good
heart:



- - - - 


Bonhoeffer is right to point out that these things can be self-centred, but they
can also be God-centred and beautiful and I don’t want to miss out on the full
expression of the language of music that speaks so clearly to my soul.

> There is no part of daily worship together that causes us such serious
> difficulties and trouble as does common prayer, for here we ourselves are
> supposed to speak. We have heard God’s Word and we have had the privilege of
> joining in the song of the church, but now we are to pray to God as a
> community, and this prayer must really be our word, our prayer—for this day,
> for our work, for our community, for the particular needs and sins that
> commonly oppress us, for the persons who are committed to our care.[^126]

[^126]: Page 68

Good suggestions on what to pray for: the day, our work, our community,
particular needs and sins, people in our care. It is so important, as Bonhoeffer
points out, that we ‘pray together to God in [our] own words.’ God wants to
hear our hearts, he wants to hear his children and it is good for us to share
ourselves in this way with him.

> Christians may and should pray together to God in their own words when they
> desire to live together under the Word of God. They have requests, gratitude,
> and intercessions to bring in common to God, and they should do so joyfully
> and confidently.[^127]

[^127]: Page 69



> Likewise, however, all our observations and criticisms should cease whenever
> weak words of prayer are offered in the name of Jesus Christ. It is in fact
> the most normal thing in our common Christian life to pray together. As good
> and useful as our scruples may be about keeping our prayer pure and biblical,
> they must nevertheless not stifle the free prayer itself that is so necessary,
> for it has been endowed with great promise by Jesus Christ.[^128]

[^128]: Page 69

An important point that we mustn’t forget. There are Christians out there who,
when they pray in their communities, find it really hard to pray from their
hearts in their own words (extemporaneously). Why is this? Maybe it’s because
of how others react to their prayers. We mustn’t comment on other people’s
prayer, except perhaps to agree with it and encourage it. In some people’s
minds, there is a lot of pressure on them when they pray, to make sure they’re
praying something doctrinally correct. I know I’ve felt this pressure. But if
we are in relationship with Jesus and we are praying to him, praying in the
Spirit, he wants to know our hearts and he will deal with any doctrinal errors
of our hearts, the doctrinal errors of our words matter so much less I think.

> scrutiny and from false subjectivity, one person should pray for all the
> community for an extended period of time.[^129]

[^129]: Page 69

I had to think a lot about this suggestion, but I have landed on the conclusion
that I think it costs more than it’s worth. I can see where Bonhoeffer might
be coming from: it is important that the community’s prayer has some order,
has some consistency, that it is always done well. But I think it’s also
important that one person isn’t set up as the prayer, the person who speaks to
God on behalf of our community.



Perhaps it should be a designated person to whom all the prayer requests go,
maybe this is needed once a community grows large enough. When people pray, they
naturally can only pray for things they are aware of and they pray in their
words, it is good to share this around so that all the concerns of the
community, all the different types of people, are part of our communal prayer.

> point every word of criticism must be transformed into more faithful
> intercession and mutual help. How easily a community can split apart if this
> is not done![^130]

[^130]: Page 69

I think Bonhoeffer is talking about praying for the ‘designated prayer’ in
people’s private prayer, but this reminded me of something that I think is
important: when we pray as a community, when someone prays for us, we should be
praying with them. It will look different in every community, but whether we
inwardly pray along with them, loudly shout ‘Amen,’ or just affirm by
saying, ‘yes,’ it’s important that we truly join together in prayer.

> Thus such a person will have to share the daily life of the community and must
> know the cares and needs, the joys and thanksgivings, the requests and hopes
> of the others. The community’s work and everything that it involves must not
> be unknown to the individual who prays for the community.[^131]

[^131]: Page 69

Bonhoeffer is talking about the person regularly prays for the community, but I
think these words are equally true when everyone in the community prays for the
community. If you’re going to pray for your community (and you should), then
you need to share its life, know the needs, joys, thanksgivings, requests and
hopes of its members. It’s important that we share these things with one
another regularly. It’s important that we have times where we share these
things.

> that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words” (Rom. 8:26).[^132]

[^132]: Page 70

I’m reminded of Bonhoeffer’s earlier words about people who don’t want to
sing. Singing is talking to God just like praying is, it’s sharing something
of ourselves with our Father and, when we do it together, with each other. We
owe it to one another to pray even when we don’t feel like it. We owe it to
one another to be supportive when someone is struggling.

[^133]: Page 71

This is so true. Written prayers can be so beautiful, so profound. I often
incorporate them into my own prayer time, but I so love sharing my heart with my
God without any man-made intermediary such as a written prayer. How many people
repeat the many words of their prayer books every day without ever engaging
their hearts?

> participation in a particular prayer service [Gebetstunde]. Any individual
> undertakings of this kind can easily plant the seed of corruption in the
> community.[^134]

[^134]: Page 71

I’m not entirely sure what Bonhoeffer is referring to here, but maybe he’s
talking about gathering together for prayer in more intimate groups. I’ve
found a great deal of benefit in joining with one or two brothers for a more
intimate time of prayer and sharing and I have a strong desire to be part of
this sort of thing. It is difficult when others don’t want to join together
like this, when I don’t have anybody to share with in this way, but Bonhoeffer
is right, these groups ‘should be held only when there is a common desire for
them and where it is certain that there will be common participation.’

> Every breaking of bread together fills Christians with gratitude for the

[^135]: Page 73

I think Bonhoeffer is actually talking about ‘breaking bread,’ about eating
together here. What a beautiful way to view such a regular occurrence: our Lord
is the giver of all good gifts, he is also the true gift, the true bread of
life, and he calls us into the eternal banquet with the reigning Father.



How does this relate to the Lord’s Supper? Bonhoeffer doesn’t really discuss
that in this chapter, but the way he describes ‘breaking bread’ together
definitely brings this to mind.

> Christian community at the table also signifies obligation. It is our daily
> bread that we eat, not my own. We share our bread. Thus we are firmly bound to
> one another not only in the Spirit, but with our whole physical being. The one
> bread that is given to our community unites us in a firm covenant. Now no one
> must hunger as long as the other has bread, and whoever shatters this
> community of our bodily life also shatters the community of the Spirit.[^136]

[^136]: Page 73

I have a lot to learn in this area. I usually view eating as just something I
have to do in order to stay alive. I’ve always been a fussy eater, I don’t
eat much, it’s never been something I’ve really enjoyed doing and when I do
it with other people I sometimes feel under a lot of pressure. I know this is
broken, I’m missing out on one of the beautiful gifts God has given us, and
it’s good to be reminded of how this builds the community that Jesus wants for
his church.

> After the first morning hour, the Christian’s day until evening belongs to
> work. “People go out to their work and to their labor until the evening”
> (Ps. 104:23). In most cases a community of Christians living together will
> separate for the duration of the working hours.[^137]

[^137]: Page 74

I’ve always wanted to be part of a community that lives together (in the same
house) centred around Jesus, under God’s Word. I still hold out hope that this
will one day happen for me. One of the things I’ve always felt that made this
really difficult was the fact that people had to go out to work, but
Bonhoeffer’s words here are an encouragement to me that this needn’t be the
barrier I thought it was.

> The work of the world can only be accomplished where people forget themselves,
> where they lose themselves in a cause, reality, the task, the It. Christians
> learn at work to allow the task to set the bounds for them. Thus, for them,
> work becomes a remedy for the lethargy and laziness of the flesh.[^138]

[^138]: Page 75



> Where it is possible, the midday hour becomes for a community of Christians
> living together a brief rest on their journey through the day. Half of the day
> is past. The congregation thanks God and asks for protection until evening.[^139]

[^139]: Page 77

Where possible, this is an awesome thing to do. It reminds us throughout the day
of who we are and whom we serve. I have never had any consistency with this in
my own personal prayer time, it’s a good opportunity to just read a passage,
take a break, say a prayer, do something.

> Where a community of Christians living together is able to be together at this
> hour for a brief daily worship time of song and prayer, it will not do so in

[^140]: Page 78



> The day’s work comes to an end. When the day has been hard and toilsome, the
> Christian will understand what Paul Gerhardt meant when he sang: “Head,
> hands and feet so tired, / Are glad the day’s expired, / That work comes to

[^141]: Page 78



> The community of Christians living together gathers together again. The
> evening breaking of bread together and the final daily worship service bring
> them together.[^142]

[^142]: Page 78

I like this sentiment. Our first words of the day are to God, our last words of
the day are also to God. God is our beginning and end.

> of the day, thus becoming the last word before the night’s rest[^143]

[^144]: Page 78

I tried to piece together what a day at Finkenwalde may have looked like in
terms of time together as a community. I’m sure I’ve gotten some things
wrong, but here’s my best idea.







- - - - 






Our Lord is the giver of all good gifts, he is also the true gift, the true
bread of life, and he calls us into the eternal banquet with the reigning
Father.
