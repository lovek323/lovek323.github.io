# 1. Why This Book?

I could not agree more. We all believe something that’s wrong, something
that’s probably deeply wrong. We may never see it but others will. We may
never be convinced of it, but it’ll still be wrong. I don’t know what I’m
believing that’s wrong, but I know there’s something. With this mindset,
when someone disagrees with me, I shouldn’t be adversarial trying to convince
them that I’m right, but using it as an opportunity to articulate and test my
views and listen and try to understand theirs. This is, naturally, a lot of
effort, so there will be some debates not worth engaging in/with.

This is worth remembering. There are Christian leaders I don’t particularly
like. They may have views I disagree with (and perhaps find damaging/dangerous)
or they may go about sharing their views in ways I can’t get behind by
engaging in exactly the kind of discussion this book is seeking to improve.
Nobody has perfect beliefs. Christian leaders aren’t born with fully formed
theological frameworks, they learn and they grow just like the rest of us, and
part of learning and growing is changing your mind or recognising and correcting
your past errors.



You can have a Godly, fruitful ministry that runs for decades and still be wrong
about some of the fundamental things on which the movement was founded. That’s
how our God works! As fallen people, it’s a great privilege to be involved in
God’s kingdom work and he lets us even though he knows we’ll get it wrong.
Ministries are fruitful because God is at work, not because of the skills or
charisma or theological weight of the ministers themselves.

We talk in Soma about how belief inevitably leads to action, so wrong action
usually stems from wrong belief. I’m not sure whether others would say action
and belief can be separated from each other like this, but I think they can.

# 3. We Know in Part

> As I argued in Revise Us Again, every follower of Jesus is a rough draft. Over

I couldn’t agree more. This is something I believe more and more in our
continually evolving society. We’re asking and attempting to respond to
questions we’ve never asked before. We’re expected to have fully formed
ethical and theological frameworks at birth I guess since we go so far back into
people’s lives to find comments and opinions to discredit them.

> Therefore, one of the mistakes we should guard against is the temptation to

> to ideas we find difficult to stomach

I find this really hard to do. I’m quite happy to dismiss someone’s
contributions – I often won’t even read what they’ve written – simply
because I disagree with some of what they’ve said or done.



Am I afraid that I’ll change my mind? Sometimes, yes, I don’t want to be
left with even more confusion by reading too far into too many sides of certain
arguments. I think I’m a little wary of wasting my time as well and certainly
some views or authors fit into this category (usually on topics I don’t feel
the need to have the fully formed view that comes from deeply reading into the
various sides or perspectives).

> Speaking personally, if I demanded that a person’s theological views be
> identical to mine, then if I met myself thirty years ago, I would have had to
> disfellowship myself!

I can say the same. I’ve had a great deal of growth and maturing and I’m
sure I’ve got a lot still to go.

# 4. Honoring Those with Whom You Disagree

> We’ve all seen it. The belligerent throwdowns where Christians take the
> gloves off with fellow believers over doctrinal, theological, and political
> differences.
> 
> Many of them can’t walk away from a fight or lose. Instead, they either pour
> coals on an already roaring fire or they bring in the gasoline trucks.

‘Many … can’t walk away from a fight or lose.’ This is so true –
it’s true of me, too. A little later, Viola uses talks about ‘agreeing to
disagree’, which I’ve always found extremely difficult. I’m not
comfortable with disagreement, I’m not comfortable with knowing people hold
different views from mine and it’s an area I’m growing and being grown in at
the moment.



I had a colleague who was doing something I wouldn’t do, and I told him what I
thought. He replied saying, ‘I’m okay if you don’t agree with me’.
Originally, I felt quite angry at this response, but later I realised I had
fallen into this trap that Viola talks about here and a trap I so often fall
into. I just can’t let people have a different opinion from me, I feel somehow
diminished by the fact that they disagree with me. It’s total rubbish, of
course.



If I can let others be different or even wrong, then I accomplish several
things: (1) I give up the burden of trying to convince people all the time, (2)
I learn to be comfortable with my own reasoning and ideas and don’t look to
others for validation of them, (3) I actually listen to people and more often
than not learn from them, (4) I have more friends and I get the kinds of
discussion I like more often because people feel safe to share their thoughts
and ideas around me, and (5) I don’t find myself regretting strongarming (at
worst) or convincing (at best) someone into something I later change my mind on.



It’s okay to disagree with people, to test one’s own ideas against
another’s, to debate, to explain, to attempt to persuade, but it’s more
important to listen and to understand than it is to be heard and to be
understood.

# 5. It&rsquo;s Not a Bloodsport

I’ve used these words before in an attempt to correct someone and eventually
as cause to remove them from our community. We saw the signs that toxins were
about to be unleashed (it was already happening and was threatening to escalate
quickly) and we had to act for the good of the person and the community.

Talking about ways Christians avoid talking about the meaning behind doctrine
and instead focus on surface concerns. I’d love to read this, understand if I
do any of these, and use that information to improve the quality of the
theological conversations I have with others.

# 6. The Shocking Beliefs of C. S. Lewis

> People pour themselves into their own doctrines, and God has to blast them out
> of their preconceived ideas before they can become devoted to Jesus Christ.
> 
> ~ Oswald Chambers



> •While he was brilliant, he was also awkward and clumsy. He never learned to
> drive an automobile or use a typewriter.

I take heart in this. Not that I am brilliant like C.S. Lewis, but that one
doesn’t have to conform to the pattern of skills and aptitudes present in so
many. I can drive, but I’m not particularly good at it, and I can certainly
use a typewriter, but I cannot swim, which so many today think is such a crucial
skill to have.

> •Later in his life, he felt that his intellectual powers for defending the
> gospel had worn thin. Consequently, he felt that he was a failure as an

I know this pain and disappointment well.

> For Lewis, purgatory was designed to create complete sanctification, not
> retribution or punishment. So Lewis saw purgatory as a work of grace.

This is one of those doctrines you’re much better not to touch in Evangelical
circles, but I still have unanswered questions. Where did it come from? Was it
really just a man-made tradition that corrupted what we were taught in the
Scriptures? It has explanatory power for some things, e.g., if this life is in
some way a preparation for eternal life, what happens to those who die but
haven’t had their character formed by suffering.

> His view was that some people may seek and find Christ without knowing Him by
> name. However, he was very clear that this was not “salvation by
> sincerity” or “goodness” but rather a Spirit-driven desire for God.

Perhaps this is why I like Lewis so much, he’s asking the same questions that
I ask. There are compelling questions that have given me some desire to
investigate universalism and to question the ‘eternal conscious torment’
idea of hell. I think the Bible is clear enough on its teaching against
universalism, some won’t make it to glory, but must that inevitably lead to
the completely opposite view, that God has abandoned those who have not heard of
Christ?

# 7. The Shocking Beliefs of Jonathan Edwards

> It takes God a long time to get us to stop thinking that unless everyone sees
> things exactly as we do, they must be wrong. That is never God’s view.
> 
> ~ Oswald Chambers

I’ve read a few different books in a few different series that go through the
various viewpoints held by evangelical theologians on different topics and I
usually find myself more drawn to the compromise or kaleidoscopic viewpoint (if
there is one) since it often seems to me that each of the other viewpoints
focuses on one part of Scripture and what it says to the detriment of other
parts of Scripture.

# 8. The Shocking Beliefs of Martin Luther

> Luther once disparaged Zwingli, saying, “I have bitten into many a nut,
> believing it to be good, only to find it wormy. Zwingli and Erasmus are
> nothing but wormy nuts that taste like crap in one’s mouth!”41

I knew Luther was angry and violent, but I didn’t know how far he went.
Calling for killing Jews, peasants (and saying he spoke under command from God),
throwing insults like this. It makes me think of someone like David who did well
when he was on the run from Saul, but failed in numerous significant ways once
he was in comfort.

# 9. The Shocking Beliefs of John Calvin

> Calvin believed that some of the Old Testament capital offenses should be
> enforced today

I read through these and I was shocked. There are doctrinal/theological
questions, like whether God wants his people to create human kingdoms with the
same laws (or similar, because it seems that Calvin’s Geneva went further even
than that) the one he created in Old Testament Israel. There are also some
obvious moral questions since it seems that Calvin and the rest of the ruling
class in Geneva acted like dictators clinging onto their power as people
weren’t allowed to criticise him in the street or really to think for
themselves, so much of their lives was very tightly controlled.

# 10. The Shocking Beliefs of Augustine

> A spiritually minded man will never come to you with the demand—“Believe
> this and that”; but with the demand that you square your life with the
> standards of Jesus. We are not asked to believe the Bible, but to believe the
> One Whom the Bible reveals (cf. John 5:39–40).
> 
> ~ Oswald Chambers

This quote is nuanced in a way I’ve been trying to capture for so many years.
We are not asked to believe the Bible, but to believe the One Whom the Bible
reveals. This is an important distinction since it highlights the truth that my
salvation and justification doesn’t depend on my theology but on Jesus.

> In matters that are obscure and far beyond our vision, even in such as we may
> find treated in Holy Scripture, different Interpretations are sometimes
> possible without prejudice to the faith we have received. In such a case, we
> should not rush in headlong and so firmly take our stand on one side that, if
> further progress in the search of truth justly undermines this position, we
> too fall with it. That would be to battle not for the teaching of Holy
> Scripture but for our own, wishing its teaching to conform to ours, whereas we
> ought to wish ours to conform to that of Sacred Scripture.

This is a great quote and reminds me of some of the work Michael Heiser has done
(I know of it in his 60 Second Scholar series and his Naked Bible podcast,
though I’m sure he’s talked about this sort of thing elsewhere) when it
comes to clinging too tightly to a particular interpretation when other
interpretations are possible. He wrote about the eternal conscious torment
theory for hell. He looked at several Bible verses that are traditionally used
to support this view and how they might otherwise be interpreted. Heiser made no
comment on his own personal view, simply making the point that other legitimate,
honest interpretations of Scripture are possible.

> Thou movest us to delight in praising Thee; for thou hast formed us for
> Thyself, and our hearts are restless till they find rest in Thee.

This is a line from a song I like (https://youtu.be/mVKjCKYSGT4), I actually
thought it was a quote from the Bible. I had no idea it was something Augustine
said.

> Further, all men are to be loved equally. But since you cannot do good to all,
> you are to pay special attention to those who, by the accidents of time, or
> place, or circumstances, are brought into closer connection with you.11

This addresses one of the struggles we all feel: there’s so much brokenness
and need in the world, how should we choose how to spend our limited time and
resources? It seems like a good answer.

> I don’t ascribe to Roman Catholic theology, but I have many friends who are
> Roman Catholic, and some of them are among the most godly people on the
> planet.

This captures well the attitude throughout this book: you don’t have to agree
with everything someone believes to see God at work in and through them.

> Augustine believed that Mary (mother of Jesus) was a perpetual virgin

This makes sense in light of his view that sexual desire is always sinful.
Without that view, the idea of Mary’s perpetual virginity would not have
seemed so appealing or necessary.

> There has been a great deal of recent debate over “original sin” in
> evangelical circles today. It was Augustine who gave the doctrine of original
> sin a key place in Christian theology.

This is interesting but not surprising. I have my own questions around how
original sin works, though I do not deny its reality. If it didn’t come into
mainstream Christian doctrine until Augustine, one wonders what the earlier
Christians thought. I’ve found Michael Heiser’s treatment of the Romans 5

:12 passage intriguing and worthy of further thought and investigation.

> Consequently, for Augustine, every infant is subject to eternal death unless
> baptized.
> 
> While some evangelicals hold to this view of original sin, others contest it,
> believing that although every person is born with a sin nature, their guilt
> arises from their actual sinful deeds rather than from Adam’s sin.

In line with my comments on the previous excerpt, this is the view I am leaning
towards, that a person’s guilt is based on what they have done (or not done),
not on their being born human. This avoids having to do some theological
gymnastics around Jesus’s perfection, but perhaps brings other problems along
with it.

> The third view that some evangelicals today reject—while others strongly
> believe it—is Augustine’s idea that hell was conscious and eternal
> torment. Augustine claimed that since the salamander can live in fire, it
> follows that God can make physical bodies that are susceptible to the pain of
> fire and yet not be damaged by it.38

As I’ve noted elsewhere, I have been thinking through the teaching I received
that hell is eternal conscious torment. I have heard some compelling arguments
that it is not the only option Scripture leaves us and that it isn’t the most
reasonable conclusion.

# 11. The Shocking Beliefs of John Wesley

> I have never met the man I could despair of after discerning what lies in me
> apart from the grace of God.
> 
> ~ Oswald Chambers

Another great quote from Oswald Chambers. I feel like I need to read more of his
work.

> As is the case with all who have the hand of God on them, Wesley faced
> unbelievable opposition from every quarter. He amassed a boatload of enemies.
> Even members of his own family caused him grief in his ministry.2

In the footnote, we’re told that Wesley’s wife opposed his work – that
would be an interesting topic to research. One of the books referenced, John
Wesley’s Failed Marriage by Nathan Busenitz, sounds like an interesting read.

> . Wesley believed that church buildings should separate men and women

I’m surprised I haven’t heard this before. I’ve learnt a lot while reading
this book. I wonder what his reasoning was.

> Like Augustine before him, Wesley believed in the perpetual virginity of Mary,
> Jesus’ earthly mother

This is the first time I’ve heard of a non-Catholic supporting this view.
Doubtless there are others and this is more down to my ignorance than anything
else, but worthy of note nonetheless. I wonder what his reasons were for this
one too.

# 12. The Shocking Beliefs of Charles Spurgeon

> Spurgeon’s collection of sermons contains over twenty million words. He is
> alleged to have read approximately six books a week and seemingly had a
> photographic memory.

Whenever I read stories of these people who read such astounding amounts of
literature I am a little jealous. I have to content myself to read one book well
every few weeks (and that rarely happens since life gets in the way and I
don’t have the discipline required).

> 1. Spurgeon was never ordained and didn’t believe that ordination was
> important. He was also against the use of honorific titles.

This is surprising. I am not convinced ordination is necessary, though I am open
to it being good, perhaps very good. I’d love to do some more study into this.

> We do not object to a recognition of the choice of the church by its neighbors
> and their ministers, on the contrary, we believe it to be a fraternal act,
> sanctioned by the very spirit of Christianity; but where it is supposed to be
> essential, is regarded as a ceremony, and is thought to be the crowning
> feature of the settlement, we demur

Talking still of ordination, I think this sums up my current thinking quite
well.

> It may be said that the title of reverend is only one of courtesy, but then so
> was the title of Rabbi among the Jews, yet the disciples were not to be called
> Rabbi.

Sounds like Spurgeon has some interesting words to say on the matter of
ordination. A poignant observation.

> While this won’t surprise many Charismatics or Pentecostals, the fact is,
> Spurgeon was Reformed. While not all Reformed people deny the present-day
> function of miraculous gifts, many do.

I’ve never had a conversation where a fellow Christian told me they didn’t
believe in miraculous gifts happening today, though I am aware of the debate
which has a ‘cessesationist’ side. I’m more cautious than some of the
Pentecostals I grew up with, but I still believe God is a God of intervention,
of miracles. Earlier, Viola talked about faith healers, and I cannot say I am at
ease with their practice (in some, perhaps many, cases, it seems to glorify –
and enrich – them far more than it does God or his kingdom). I like the
balance Spurgeon struck here, believing in miracles and praying for people
privately without drawing attention to it.

> “Seekest thou great things for thyself, seek them not!”

These are the words Spurgeon heard that kept him preaching without a formal
theological education. It speaks to a danger I have felt and I’m sure many
others feel and some succumb to. In our Christian circles, having a theological
education brings respect, honour, privilege, and position, as does being called
a pastor. It’s something to be guarded against.

> Spurgeon believed God answered the prayers of people before they were
> converted to Christ

This is another interesting one worth studying. I don’t have a strong opinion
on it. My initial thought is that Jesus’s sacrifice for us tore down the
barrier between man and God, which would in turn allow anyone to cry out to God
for help – God loves everyone and causes the rain to fall on the righteous and
the unrighteousness, why wouldn’t he answer a non-believer’s prayer? God
intervened in the lives of the magi who neither believed in Jesus nor were part
of Israel, sending them to meet Jesus at his birth. I have gone back and forth
on this issue a bit in my lifetime and I wonder what other options there are out
there.

# 13. The Shocking Beliefs of D. L. Moody

> When he began his ministry in the Chicago slums (called “Little Hell”
> because of its danger), Moody was barely into his twenties. He had a heart for
> the least, the last, and the lost, spending all of his savings to help the
> indigent, even risking harm to himself.9

I love stories like this, they capture the heart of Jesus so well. It might be
time to read a biography of Moody’s life.

> When Moody caught criticism for this, his response was, “A great many people
> say I don’t preach on the terrors of religion. I don’t want to—don’t
> want to scare men into the kingdom of God.”

Moody rarely preached on hell. So many Christians have criticised others for
this same thing, and I see where they’re coming from, since it is a part of
what God has revealed to us. However, the Bible does seem to say that love is
the most important virtue and that it is defining for God, God is love. In a
world where Christians are known much more for the judgement and condemnation
they bring (not our job, by the way) than the love of Christ that they show to
the world and to each other, Moody’s approach seems pretty good. I don’t
think a person can be scared into becoming a Christian, you can’t trust and
believe in Jesus simply out of fear for what will happen if you don’t.

> That said, Moody was not precise about the details of Christ’s second
> coming, so we cannot be sure of his exact views on the subject. In a sermon
> entitled “When My Lord Jesus Comes,” Moody said, “You should study the
> Bible for yourself, and come to your own conclusion.”13

This is an important message for today’s Christians: study the Bible for
yourself! So many people farm their theological thinking off to their pastor or
their denomination, but God has given us something to study and wrestle with
ourselves. Naturally, it’s not the most important question to answer, so if a
person doesn’t want to study and come to their own conclusion on this one, I
think it’s okay too.

> Moody rejected evolutionary theory, but that didn’t dissuade him from
> befriending and endorsing Henry Drummond. Nor did it dissuade others from
> condemning Moody with the same vitriol that they leveled against Drummond.
> (Regrettably, this sort of thing still happens today in the Christian world.)

It is deeply regrettable that this sort of thing happens among Christians. Why
is it so difficult to accept that it’s possible for two people both to follow
Jesus wholeheartedly but hold different positions on matters like this?

> 6. Moody believed in interdenominational ecumenicism.
> 
> This also disturbed hard-core Calvinists and Arminians.

Why are we so focused on saying who’s in and who’s out? Why must we build
walls around ourselves? Why do we need the lines to be drawn so clearly? God is
not Calvinist, God is not Arminian, it should not be controversial to say both
camps are deeply wrong in ways we don’t currently understand, and yet it is.

There are verses in the Bible that have this message, that what we do on earth
after accepting Jesus has eternal consequences. In particular, I had not thought
to connect the story of Lot with Paul’s words in 1 Corinthians 3:15

 (if that is indeed what Moody is doing here).

# 14. Seven Shocking Statements by Billy Graham

> I’ve met people in various parts of the world in tribal situations, that
> they have never seen a Bible or heard about a Bible, and never heard of Jesus,
> but they’ve believed in their hearts that there was a God, and they’ve
> tried to live a life that was quite apart from the surrounding community in
> which they lived

This is an important issue. I know what the majority view is, and I may side
with that too, but the question of how someone could be genuinely seeking truth
and God and get nowhere flies in the face of some of what we’re told in the
Bible: seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened, ask and it
will be given to you.

> Yes. I would study more. I would pray more. Travel less. Take less speaking
> engagements. I took too many of them, in too many places around the world. If
> I had to do it over again, I would spend more time in meditation and prayer,
> and just telling the Lord how much I love Him and adore Him, and I’m looking
> forward to the time we’re going to spend together for eternity.
> 
> This response may be surprising to those who believe that the name of the game
> in Christianity is service. Graham later realized that it’s not.

Asked whether he would do anything differently, Graham said he would worship
more and work less. So many have criticised the Catholic idea of opus dei, the
work of God – by which they mean prayer, meditation, worship – saying that
God has given us the task of evangelism. There is, as always, a middle ground,
and it seems that Graham thought he was more on the work side and it would have
been better had he been more on the worship side (though there need not be a
clear line between the two).

# 15. The New Tolerance

> The only way to keep true to God is by a steady persistent refusal to be
> interested in Christian work and to be interested alone in Jesus Christ.
> 
> ~ Oswald Chambers

This quote bears out what Graham was saying earlier, worship comes first, work
second, work flows from a worshipful life.

> Disagreeing with a person’s habits, values, or ideas isn’t the equivalent
> of hating, fearing, despising, or wishing them ill.
> 
> Loving a person doesn’t mean approving their practices or beliefs.
> 
> Love and approval aren’t the same thing.

This is such an important point. I remember reading the book The Gospel Comes
with a House Key where the author was on the phone to a friend and they had a
conversation where it became clear she did not agree with some of her friend’s
choices since becoming a Christian. She had a great line (that I will try to
find) that their friendship had never before been based on total agreement,
she’d never approved of everything her friend did, and that hadn’t impacted
their friendship before, and nothing needed to change in that regard. This is a
truth that we need to embrace as a society: you can’t bully or pressure people
into agreeing with you and you need to be okay when they don’t. Historically,
Christians have not been good at this, we’ve pressured, tortured, bullied,
condemned those who disagree with us and most of us are only starting to see the
problem this is because the shoe’s on the other foot. I don’t expect to be
popular, I don’t even expect to be respected, maybe I’ll be cancelled like
so many before me and that’s okay, but I do hope that people don’t hear me
saying ‘I don’t love you’ when I say ‘I disagree with you’.

# 16. You Just Might Be a Pharisee If . . .

What a great quote! I’ve got some work to do to move from being a Pharisee to
Tozer’s ‘spiritual man’.

> As E. Stanley Jones rightly pointed out, “The measure of my spirit of

A quote worth remembering. I’m a critical person because it’s where I feel
comfortable. Now, I comfort myself because I’m not (usually) critical of
people but of things like clothes or houses, but they are people’s expression
so the line is pretty thin between the two.

> You impute evil motives to the hearts of others (then call it
> “discernment”).

I’ve never called it ‘discernment’, but I often think I understand
what’s going on in people’s hearts and I’m almost always wrong. I ascribe
evil motives to people, assuming the worst of them. Thankfully, God has
surrounded me with people who are resolute against this and my way of thinking
is starting to shift.

# 17. Twenty Reasons Why the Christian Right and the Christian Left Won&rsquo;t
Adopt Me

> Why the Christian Right Won’t Adopt Me

The following list of viewpoints is intriguing to me and I find that I hold or
am at lest interested in or attracted to many of them.

> •Like F. F. Bruce, I believe words like plenary and inerrant are
> unnecessary when speaking about the truthfulness of Scripture

The confusion around ‘Biblical inerrancy’ has caused so much damage. People
have lost their faith when they find that the Bible wasn’t something it never
claimed to be. Are typos evidence that the Bible isn’t God’s word? Are
incorrect or incomplete observations about the natural world evidence of this?
What about drawing theological conclusions based on their (flawed) scientific
understanding where the conclusion is valid but the illustration used to convey
it hasn’t aged well? We don’t need to be so dogmatic about things, we can
allow our definitions to change as we learn and grow and understand, we don’t
need to operate out of fear and batten down the hatches.

> •I don’t believe the Bible clearly addresses the question of the eternal
> destiny of those who have never heard or understood the gospel of Jesus
> Christ.

This is something that’s come up several times throughout this book. I
haven’t thought about it for a long time, and I’m not sure that I’ll
devote a lot of time to it in the near future, but I think this captures my
current thinking quite well.

I’m coming to see this too. It seems to me (or at least this is how I use
them) that some systematic theologies attempt to get the Bible to answer our
questions instead of immersing oneself in the questions the authors (both human
and divine) intended to answer. Good systematic theologies that are well
informed by biblical theology do exist and are worth reading, but our primary
way of interacting with and understanding the Bible and the Gospel should be
through the narrative as it has been given to us.

I’ve thought I would disagree strongly with a person’s argument, but when I
asked questions and listened to it, I sometimes  found that either, (1) I was
able to see their point of view, and (2) I realised we didn’t really disagree.
However, there is a third option and it’s down to my own discomfort with
conflict, I find myself agreeing with them in order to avoid conflict, so I end
up feeling like I haven’t been honest, I feel weak, and so on.



There are many reasons I struggle so much with conflict, and it’s something
I’d love to grow in. I need to believe what was written in the previous
chapter, that it is possible to ‘walk hand in hand without seeing eye to
eye’ with someone. I am learning to be okay with not being understood, to give
up the need and desire to convince everyone and have them agree with me or I
with them. I am learning how to civilly disagree, to stand strong in what I
believe without diminishing others or their intelligence.

This is such an important point, it’s been made several times throughout this
book, and it’s one that I hadn’t realised deeply enough. I have known that I
should assume the best of others, but not thought through the fact that God’s
the only one who can assess motives.

I’m so afraid of disagreement. When I meet Christians with whom I disagree,
I’m afraid of asking them about it, I have these general impressions that I
know I won’t stand up under questioning. I am uncomfortable with the thought
that we might disagree on some significant point that I’m uncomfortable with
the person. The people I’m most uncomfortable with are ones I believe to have
erected walls of who’s in and who’s out, to have elevated doctrine about God
above belief in God in their definition of the kingdom, I’m afraid because I
think they’ll exclude me.

This is a good rule, it helps us to put certain things into the disputable
matters category, and it helps us to reject completely innovative ideas. Viola
goes on to say that the apostolic tradition takes primacy of place, which makes
sense if we’re talking about what Christians have always believed, as they
were the first Christians. Of course, one cannot bundle in all the views of
people who have simply called themselves Christian and so perhaps it’s not as
useful as one might otherwise have thought.

This is such a crucial point and covers most of what I find uncomfortable in
myself and other Christians when it comes to conflict. I do think we need to act
against false teaching, but it’s worth considering how we can do it gently,
and it’s worth contacting one we believe is teaching falsely to ask for
clarification if needed. Viola discusses this a little more when it comes to
people who ‘[cause] division’, i.e., heretics.

Such an important truth. There are many things that I question simply because I
don’t understand them, I’m not at the point of denying them, for one cannot
deny what one does not understand.







# 24. Who Are the Real Heretics?

Talking about ‘orthodox Christian teaching’, these groups from time to time
all claim to have the monopoly on that; they claim to possess if not the
absolute truth, the closest of any Christian group. I can see how the Roman
Catholics or the Eastern Orthodox could make this claim, though I disagree with
it. I cannot, however, see how others can make such a claim honestly.



By declaring themselves right, they are declaring others wrong. They make
judgements on all kinds of disputable matters and elevate them to requirements
for membership into their churches. By doing this, they seem to have more
requirements for Christian fellowship than Christ or the apostles. I have met
and conversed with some of these people and I have been one myself.

I’ve never heard this before and there’s a lot more thinking I have to do on
it. Is there a difference between a conflict-ridden division and an amicable
separation? Church splits always take sides, are both heretics? Is it simply a
matter of majority rules? Is it up to the elders appointed by the congregation?
This definition of a heretic both rings true and feels incomplete and perhaps
even dangerous at the same time. Splitting a church is never good, but what if
people leave in open and familial discussion with the existing church
leadership? What if a church leader needs to be called to account? What if that
calling to account causes some to leave with the new church leader? So many
questions!

To my knowledge, I’ve never been called a heretic, and I’ve not used the
term against another Christian. This might be more of an issue in America, where
Frank Viola does much of his ministry, or perhaps it occurs more in Internet
discussions which I am not often a part of. Nevertheless, it’s useful to have
this definition for what a heretic is.
