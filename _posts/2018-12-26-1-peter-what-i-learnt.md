For the last 6 weeks, I have been writing on things I've learned while studying
1 Peter. I learnt a lot, both from my studies and by going through the process
of writing about them. I'll summarise what I learnt here.

# What I Learnt from Studying 1 Peter

Those who have read my blog posts will know that my process is not to try to
summarise a chapter, but to focus tightly on a particular verse or small section
and try to gain an understanding of something I've previously overlooked. When
you read through the following list of things I've learnt, just remember that
I'm not attempting to summarise the chapter, but to summarise what I learnt.

## [1 Peter 1](/2018/11/19/1-peter-1.html)

- It matters how we live
- The fear of judgment plays a role in the Christian life

## [1 Peter 2](/2018/11/26/1-peter-2.html)

- The pure spiritual milk we are to crave is Christ: *spiritual* experiences of
  him and *rational* experiences of him
- I must have a desire to grow in faith

## [1 Peter 3: Part 1](/2018/12/03/1-peter-3-part-1.html)

- It is not possible to lose salvation
- We are justified by faith *with* works
- The doctrine of *sola fide* is not a watering down of God's holiness or our
  sinfulness

## [1 Peter 3: Part 2](/2018/12/10/1-peter-3-part-2.html)

- Like-mindedness is not having the same opinions but sharing the same way of
  thinking, the same hopes, going to the same place/person for answers
- It is not good for Christians to defend themselves to the world

## [1 Peter 4](/2018/12/17/1-peter-4.html)

- It is not good for Christians to meddle in things that are none of their
  business

## [1 Peter 5](/2018/12/24/1-peter-5.html)

- Worry is prideful, casting our cares on God is humble
- When I hold on to my cares, I am saying to God, 'You don't care for me'
- As a Christian, I cannot expect or demand that people understand me; I should
  expect that they won't

# What I Learnt from Writing about 1 Peter

In addition to what I learned from my actual studies of the Bible, I also learnt
about the process of writing. I'm sure there is a *lot* left for me to learn,
but here are some things that I learnt:

1. **Don't try to combine everything I want to say into a single post**

   For the first few posts, I wrote a section at the beginning talking about the
   process I was using to studying the Word. This was something I enjoyed
   writing about. It's also an area where I expect to grow a lot as I continue
   to study the Word and learn how to do it better. I think this makes for a
   disjointed reading experience and perhaps distracts from the primary purpose
   of the series. I still aim to write about the process of studying and
   writing, but I won't combine it with articles about what I've learnt from my
   studies.

2. **Don't add things just to fill out the page**

   I was worried that I wouldn't have enough to say on any given week (I'm not
   sure where I got this idea, having something to say is not usually an issue
   for me), so I added two sections that were intermediate steps along the way.

   - *Interesting things.* A list of the parts of the passage that I considered
     studying. Whatever I found interesting as I read through the passage
     throughout the week perhaps including a thought I had at the time. I came
     to the conclusion that, while the thoughts in this section made sense to me
     (I knew *why* I found something interesting, what I wanted to research,
     what other thoughts it triggered in my mind when I read it), they really
     didn't add much to the blog and it wasn't likely it would make sense or be
     enjoyable to anyone reading the blog.
   - *Outline.* An outline of the passage pulled from one of the commentaries I
     read during my studies. My original hope was to try to place the passage
     under study in the context of the whole book, and perhaps it did this, but
     I found when trying to just read a commentator's outline, the best that
     could happen was I would want to read the chapter. Not only this, I'm not
     trying to write a commentary, I'm not trying to write a thorough treatment
     of the whole text, I'm just trying to share what I think God is saying to
     me (and perhaps to others) as I read and study the Bible, which is a
     purpose that an outline doesn't really serve.

3. **The beginning parts of commentaries are there for a reason**

   I have not always enjoyed the sometimes significant chunks of text at the
   beginning of most commentaries dealing with authorship, date, audience, and
   so on. And I thought I could avoid discussing these issues, but I came to the
   conclusion that I was missing out. When I would read in a commentary that
   certain scholars rejected Petrine authorship, or that 1 Peter was written to
   Anatolian believers who were suffering a particular kind of persecution, and
   so on, I found that I was missing the context required to understand what the
   commentators were saying, but I also found that I didn't have an opinion of
   my own. I intend to devote some weeks at the beginning of my study of a book
   to these subjects. I'm not sure whether I'll have a post on each (authorship,
   date, audience) or a single post for all three, I'll play it by ear, see how
   I go.

4. **Podcasts are hard**

   I originally intended to make audio recordings of my blog posts for those who
   don't enjoy reading. I love reading, but I also love listening to podcasts
   and audio books and I have some recording equipment at home, so I thought it
   would be easy. It turns out that the way I wrote things wasn't really
   conducive to having them read aloud. It also turns out that podcasts take a
   lot of time and I'm not as perfect a speaker as I had thought. I will try to
   write with the spoken word in mind more and to record podcasts for the next
   series on 2 Peter but I make no guarantees.
