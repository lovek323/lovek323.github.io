In my [last post](2018/12/26/1-peter-what-i-learnt.html) I wrote of my intention
to begin my study of each new book by looking into the book's authorship, date
and audience. I expect that this kind of investigation on a book will yield
different results for each book. For 2 Peter, I discovered something I didn't
expect: for the first few centuries of the church, the status of 2 Peter along
with certain other New Testament books was disputed.[^1][^2]

[^1]:
    'So although the four gospels, Acts, the letters of Paul, 1 Peter, and 1
    John were almost universally accepted, everything else was to some degree
    questionable.' (Gamble 1992: 856)

[^2]:
    Eusebius wrote that 'we have learned that [Peter's] extant second Epistle
    does not belong to the canon; yet, as it has appeared profitable to many, it
    has been used with the other Scriptures' (1890: 133) and that 'among the
    disputed writings, which are nevertheless recognized by many, are &hellip;
    also the second epistle of Peter' (ibid.: 156).

Not only did the early church initially have a low opinion of 2 Peter, Luther
apparently rejected Hebrews, James, Jude, 2 Peter and Revelation[^3][^4] because
they did not satisfy his criterion of them being 'actually written by apostles
or composed under their direction' (Strong 1907: 237). Luther seems to have
created a hierarchy of the New Testament books: the books of John, 1 John,
Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, 1 Peter (in this order) are, according to Luther,
'the books that show you Christ and teach you all that is necessary and
salvatory for you to know, even if you were never to see or hear any other books
or doctrine' (1999: 362).

[^3]:
    According to A.H. Strong, 'Luther refused canonical authority to books not
    actually written by apostles or composed (as Mark and Luke) under their
    direction. So he rejected from the rank of canonical authority Hebrews,
    James, Jude, 2 Peter, Revelation. Even Calvin doubted the Petrine authorship
    of 2 Peter, excluded the book of Revelation from the Scripture on which he
    wrote Commentaries, and also thus ignored 2 and 3 John.' (Strong 1907: 237)
   
   See the rest of Strong's section _Certain books unworthy of a place in
   inspired Scripture_ for a fuller discussion of this topic where he argues for
   the value of these disputed books.

[^4]:
    In the prefaces included in his translation of the Bible, Luther gave a
    range of thoughts on the New Testament and what the gospel is. After this,
    under the heading 'Which are the true and noblest books of the New
    Testament' (this section did not appear in any editions of Luther's New
    Testament after 1537), Luther wrote 'From all this you can now judge all the
    books and decide among them which are the best. John's Gospel and St. Paul's
    epistles, especially that to the Romans and St. Peter's first epistle are
    the true kernel and marrow of all the books. They ought properly to be the
    foremost books, and it would be advisable for every Christian to read them
    first and most, and by daily reading to make them as much his own as his
    daily bread. For in them you do not find many works and miracles of Christ
    described, but you do find depicted in masterly fashion how faith in Christ
    overcomes sin, death, and hell, and gives life, righteousness, and
    salvation. This is the real nature of the gospel, as you have heard.'
    (Luther 1999: 361&ndash;362)

M. Green summarised the situation of 2 Peter, saying: 'This Epistle has had a
very rough passage down the centuries. Its entry into the Canon was precarious
in the extreme. At the Reformation it was deemed second-class Scripture by
Luther, rejected by Erasmus, and regarded with hesitancy by Calvin.' (Green
1987: 19)

Nevertheless, 2 Peter was eventually accepted into the canons of all the major
branches of Christianity. Eusebius noted that it 'appeared profitable to many,
it has been used with the other Scriptures' (1980: 133) and that it was
'recognized by many' (ibid.: 156).

# Authorship

Modern scholarship seems to largely reject the Petrine authorship of 2
Peter.[^5]

[^5]:
    'Why is it, then, that a quick survey of recent commentaries reveals that
    more than half of them do not think that the apostle Peter wrote this
    letter?' (Moo 1996: 22)

2 Peter itself seems to claim Petrine authorship:

- The first words of the book claim Petrine authorship: 'Simon Peter, a servant
  and apostle of Jesus Christ' (2:1a, NIV)

- There is a potential allusion to Jesus' words in John 21:18: 'I think it is
  right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body,
  because I know that I will soon put it aside **as our Lord Jesus Christ has
  made clear to me**' (1:13&ndash;14, NIV; cf. Moo 1996: 22).[^6]

- The author of 2 Peter claims to have been present at the transfiguration: 'For
  we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming
  of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. He
  received honour and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from
  the Majestic Glory, saying, "This is my son, whom I love; with him I am well
  pleased." **We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were
  with him on the sacred mountain.**' (1:16&ndash;18, NIV)

[^6]:
    'The allusion in 1:14 need not be a reference to the text of John
    21:18&ndash;19 but could just as well have been a personal reminiscence of
    the author. Indeed, the note that his demise would come soon argues against
    such dependency since John includes no similar note.' (Green 2008: 150)

According to the _Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary_, 2 Peter resembles a literary
form known as _testament_:

> 2 Peter thus resembles other parting addresses or testaments contained in the
> NT &hellip; Generally pseudepigraphical, the testament was a literary form
> employed to address current issues as the anticipation or forecast of some
> venerable figure of the past and thereby secure for its teaching the authority
> antiquity offers. (Elliott 1992: 283)

This is not, however, a universally accepted argument:

> 2 Peter does not follow the conventions of the testamentary genre and is quite
> dissimilar to known testaments. (Green 2008: 149)

If we consider the internal claims to Petrine authorship, some of which I have
outlined above, I think the most reasonable conclusion is that 'the author
intends that his readers will recognize this letter as an authentic work of the
principal apostle, Peter' (Green 2008: 139). There does not seem to be an easy
way to view 2 Peter as a forgery and accept it in the canon of scripture. Thus,
'we have to choose between (1) viewing 2 Peter as a forgery, intended perhaps to
claim an authority that the author did not really have&mdash;and therefore omit
it from the canon; and (2) viewing 2 Peter as an authentic letter of the apostle
Peter' (Moo 1996: 23&ndash;24)

> The arguments forwarded to affirm the authenticity of the letter have not
> received a favorable hearing [referring to Moo's 1996 work among others], and
> the failure to convince cannot be fully ascribed to entrenched skepticism.
> Current literature mirrors the unevenness of the letter's reception in the
> early church and the ancient concerns voiced about its origin. The
> contemporary reader must on one hand decide whether the arguments against the
> book's authenticity are cogent, and on the other whether there is sufficient
> warrant to affirm that the letter came from Peter. (Green 2008: 139&ndash;140)

With regard to the early church, 2 Peter seems to be in a middle ground, with
less evidence supporting it than other canonical writings but more evidence than
any of the rejected writings.

G.L. Green concludes that 'we may reasonably affirm that Simon Peter, the
apostle, authored the book':

> The verdict of the early church was ambiguous at first, but the problem of
> literary style in comparison to 1 Peter accounts for the early doubts. The
> book was used early and, according to early witnesses, used widely. The book
> is decidedly dissimilar to later literature that went under the name of Peter,
> such as the Acts of Peter, the Preaching of Peter, the gnostic Apocalypse of
> Peter, and even the early-second-century Apocalypse of Peter. The concerns
> raised within the letter fit well within the struggles of the church of the
> first century, and we may reasonably affirm that Simeon Peter, the apostle,
> authored the book. The letter stands within the circle of early Christian
> theology and serves as a witness to the struggles and dangers that the faith
> faced during its youngest years. (Green 2008: 150)

In reply to Luther's criticisms of certain books along with Huldrych Zwingli and
Thomas Arnold's rejection of Revelation, A.H. Strong wrote that 'the testimony
of church history and general Christian experience to the profitableness and
divinity of the disputed books is of greater weight than the personal
impressions of the few who criticize them' (1907: 237). This is a helpful line
of reasoning and, though I have doubts, along with certain arguments in Green's
commentary, and a belief that the Spirit worked through the church to bring and
preserve the Scriptures, is enough to satisfy me for now as I move on to study
the text of 2 Peter. I hope to return to the topic of the canon and inspiration
for further study at some point in the not-too-distant future.

# Date

There is some evidence that 2 Peter existed in the second century (cf. Green
2008: 140) and there are various discussions on whether 2 Peter preceded Jude or
vice versa (it seems that many scholars have landed on the position that Jude
preceded 2 Peter). The date of the book influences and is influenced by any
conclusions on authorship. I could not come to a definitive conclusion on the
authorship of the book in the time I had and thus I have not drawn any
conclusions regarding its most likely date. The best I can do is offer a brief
survey of what others say on the matter.

Estimates range from mid-first century to mid-second century. If Peter wrote the
letter, then a date in the late 60s would make sense.[^7] If a secretary or
disciple of Peter wrote the letter, then the date could be more like
80&ndash;90. Those who take 2 Peter to be pseudonymous generally support dates
in the 110&ndash;125 range, though dates as late as 150 have been suggested.[^8]

[^7]:
    'If it was written by Simon Peter (even if an assistant was primarily
    responsible for the composition of the letter), and if one accepts the
    tradition that Peter was martyred in ROme under Nero, then the work must
    have been written by A.D. 68 (the death of Nero), and most probably between
    A.D. 64 (the Great Fire in Rime, which marked the start of Nero's
    persecution of Christians) and A.D. 68.' (Davids 2006: 130)

[^8]:
    'If what we have stated leaves us with some lack of clarity, we can say that
    it is absolutely clear that 2 Peter was written before A.D. 140 and most
    likely before A.D. 110 since that is the probable range of dates within
    which the Apocalypse of Peter was written, a work that borrows from 2 Peter.
    Thus we have the period of A.D. 64&ndash;110 as the range within which the
    work was probably written, whatever one holds about its authorship. (Davids
    2006: 131)

# Audience

Several passages indicate that 2 Peter was intended for a specific church (cf.
Estes et al. 2016):

- 'To those who through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ
  have received a faith as precious as ours' (1:1b, NIV).

- 'For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the
  coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power' (1:16a, NIV).

- 'Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you.' (3:1a, NIV)

- 'But do not forget this one thing, dear friends' (3:8a, NIV).

- 'So then, dear friends' (3:14a).

While it does seem that the letter was written to a specific church, we don't
know the identity of this church. Perhaps it was the same audience as 1 Peter
(if the first letter inferred from 2 Peter 3:1 is 1 Peter), but it could just as
easily be a different church.

> If one rejects this identification, then the only thing we know about the
> recipients is that they probably were not located in the eastern end of the
> Mediterranean (Syria, Palestine, and Babylon) nor were they predominantly
> Jewish (2 Peter expects them to be very familiar with Greco-Roman ideas, but
> it does not expect them to know a lot of Jewish literature). (Davids 2006:
> 132&ndash;133)
