# What I Learnt from Studying 2 Peter

For the last 4 weeks, I've been studying and writing about 2 Peter. I learnt a
lot. 2 Peter touched on a lot of heavy theological topics, primarily the
responsibility Christians have to live holy lives (a.k.a. works), false teaching
and the end times.

## [2 Peter: Introduction](/2019/12/31/2-peter-introduction.html)

1. Though 2 Peter is included in the canon (and thus for most of us the debate
   is over), many throughout the church's history have questioned its status as
   a canonical book

2. I stil believe 2 Peter was most likely written by Peter, but I'm increasingly
   in the minority with this view

## [2 Peter 1](/2019/01/07/2-peter-1.html)

1. _Godly_ means 'devoutly religious; pious' (OED) not 'being like God' like I
   thought it meant

2. The tension surrounding the balance between God's effort and human effort is
   not as easily handled as I thought

## [2 Peter 2](/2019/01/14/2-peter-2.html)

1. False teaching is not new (it was in the Old Testament, it was in the New
   Testament, and it's around today) &ndash; one of the marks of false teaching
   is bringing in philosophy from outside the church, which is something I've
   done in the past and am probably still doing today without knowing

2. The day of judgement is real &ndash; and it matters what we do _now_

## [2 Peter 3: Cosmic Eschatology](/2019/01/21/2-peter-3-cosmic-eschatology.html)

1. Eschatology is complex and anyone who says they know for sure about the
   details is more confident than I think is warranted

2. Of the eschatological perspectives I researched, amillennialist idealism
   makes most sense to me (but I hold it loosely)

3. Eschatology matters for us today, knowing that Jesus will return to judge the
   world should spur us on to holiness

# What I Learnt from Writing about 2 Peter

It seems like a good idea to add titles to each post.

I added a title 'Cosmic Eschatology' to the post on 2 Peter 3. It's not the best
title, I didn't give a lot of thought to it, it was just a phrase that I saw
when I was researching the post. I'd like to add titles to future posts as it
makes it easier to search through them and find particular ones but also it
might make them more attractive to Google.

# Next Week

Next, for a change of pace, I'll be reading and studying Amos. It'll be the
first time I've seriously looked into an Old Testament prophet and I have very
little idea what I'll find.
