# Amos &ndash; Introduction

Last week I was in Sydney for work, so I was not able to finish writing and
publish my post. I don't think anyone was waiting with baited breath so I doubt
I've disappointed anyone, but if there is someone out there who was waiting for
it, I'm sorry you had to wait.

After reading various introductions to Amos, I decided I wanted to learn a bit
more about biblical criticism, so I've read through a couple of books on the
topic and have summarised what I learnt with a particular focus on how biblical
criticism applies to the Old Testament prophets.


# I. Biblical Criticism

One of the books I read was an e-book called _Understanding Biblical Criticism_
credited to F.F. Bruce and based on a range of Bruce's articles.

> [_Understanding Biblical Criticism_'s] theme is simply that both textual
> criticism and the various forms of higher criticism are proper branches of
> Bible study even though the idea of biblical criticism often stirs up
> suspicion or even hostility. Such negative reaction occurs, first, because the
> word "criticism" can imply fault-finding and, second, because some prominent
> biblical critics come to their study with skepticism of the historical value
> of the Bible.[^1]

    Publisher's introduction to _Understanding Biblical Criticism.

Some scholars approach the biblical text with the assumption that miracles
cannot happen, that it is not possible for prophets to have received details
about the future from God. Perhaps the mistrust of biblical criticism that is
sometimes seen in Christians is because they conflate these two things. Some
scholars who operate in the realm of biblical criticism do not accept the
possibility of the supernatural and so their conclusions are, at times, opposed
to what Christians believe; they do not draw these conclusions _because of_
biblical criticism alone but _because of_ their initial assumptions or bias
in combination with their studies. Naturally, Christians disagree with those who
say miracles do not occur, that God does not intervene in his creation. It is
not an issue with biblical criticism itself but with the worldview of the
scholar. There are scholars (such as F. F. Bruce) who are decidedly evangelical
and whose work in biblical criticism can enlighten and encourage the church.

    David B. Capes, introduction to _Understanding Biblical Criticism_, by F. F.
    Bruce (Nashville, TN; Bath, England: Kingsley Books, 2017).

I am not going to defend the use of biblical criticism any more than this (read
F. F. Bruce's book for yourself for an excellent argument in favour of it), but
since it will likely feature to some degree in this series on Amos and in future
series on OT prophets, I have decided to attempt a brief overview of the methods
of studying the bible known as "biblical criticism".

What do you think when you hear the word "criticism"? I think of putting
something down, of finding and exposing its faults. But in academic usage,
"criticism" doesn't mean finding the faults in something, but assessing the
merits and flaws in various arguments (e.g., which text is more faithful to the
original). The _Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary_ says that:

> The word "criticism" comes from the Greek verb _krinein_, which means to
> distinguish, decide, or judge. Biblical criticism therefore is the practice of
> analyzing and making discriminating judgments about the literature of the
> Bible&mdash;its origin, transmission, and interpretation. In this context,
> "criticism" has no negative connotation but, as in other fields, is designed
> to promote discriminating analysis and understanding.[^4]

    David Noel Freedman, ed., "Biblical Criticism," in _The Anchor Yale Bible
    Dictionary_ (New York: Doubleday, 1992), 1:725&ndash;726.

New Testament criticism has been around since at least Clement of Alexandria (c.
150&ndash;c. 215 AD), whose "story that John's gospel provided a 'spiritual'
complement to the 'bodily' Synoptic Gospels gives us a glimpse of the process of
criticism that led to the acceptance of a fourfold gospel canon."[^5]

    Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary_, ed.  David Noel Freedman, (New York:
    Doubleday, 1992), 1:726.

## I.A. Textual Criticism

The original texts of the books of the Bible are sometimes called _autographs_
(though as Bruce points out, "this term can be used properly only where the
author actually wrote his own work"[^6].) We don't have the biblical autographs,
the original texts. What we have are fragments of varying lengths from varying
times. A lot of work has been done to put together our English translations and,
before any translation work can be done, we need to try to work out the original
text. This is done by critically comparing the surviving copies and is known as
_textual criticism_.

[^6]:
    Bruce, _Understanding Biblical Criticism_, ch. 2.

F. F. Bruce gives two amusing examples of printer's errors that can be
identified through textual criticism:

> Even printed editions of the Bible have suffered at times from some very odd
> misprints. There was, for example, the "Wicked Bible" of 1632&mdash;an edition
> of the King James Version&mdash;which was so called because the vital word
> "not" was omitted from the seventh commandment. For this inadvertence
> Archbishop Laud fined the printers &#163;300. Another edition of the King
> James Version exhibits the most appropriate misprint in the Book of Psalms:
> "Printers have persecuted me without cause"![^7]

[^7]:
    ibid.

I thought textual criticism would be a dry subject that I'd research a little
and then discard, but it turns out to involve a wide range of interesting
aspects not least of which are examples of where textual criticism (as well as
more manuscripts being discovered) has given us slight changes in English
versions. One example of this comes from 1 John 3:1 (the bold text shows the
added text, the [&hellip;] shows where it would have been in the KJV):

* KJV: "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we
  should be called the sons of God **[&hellip;]**: therefore the world knoweth
  us not, because it knew him not."

* RSV: "See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children
  of God; **[and so we are]**. The reason why the world does not know us is that
  it did not know him."

* NIV: "See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be
  called children of God! **And that is what we are!** The reason the world does
  not know us is that it did not know him."

It doesn't change the meaning, but it adds a nice emphasis. There are (I am
sure) many other examples, but I'll leave it here and move on.

## I.B. Source Criticism

Built on the foundation of textual criticism, source criticism is a "method of
biblical study which analyzes texts that are not the work of a single author but
result from the combination of originally separate documents" [^8]. Source
criticism has at times been known as _literary criticism_ and _higher criticism_
(with textual criticism being known as _lower criticism_).

[^8]:
    David Noel Freedman, ed., "Source Criticism," _The Anchor Yale Bible
    Dictionary_, 162.

> In turn, "higher criticism" is built on the foundation laid by textual
> criticism. This made sense since you can say little about anything else until
> you determine what the text itself says. The higher criticisms were concerned
> with questions of composition, authorship, sources used by the writers, and
> forms that stories took on in the period prior to their being written down in
> texts now available to us. While Bruce was primarily a New Testament scholar,
> many of these essays have to do with the kinds of questions that occupied the
> attention of Old Testament specialists.[^9]

[^9]:
    Capes, introduction.

> In Old Testament scholarship until recently, literary criticism meant noticing
> such things as inconsistency, incoherence, and differences of style, in order
> to separate the stages in a book's composition, and find its original form.
> This method of studying biblical books was at the forefront of scholarship in
> the modern period, that is, from the late nineteenth century on. In
> Pentateuchal studies, Julius Wellhausen formulated the well-known
> four-document theory (JEDP).[^10]

    Gordon McConville, The Prophets_. Vol. 4 of _Exploring the Old Testament_
    (London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 2002), xvii.

> The problems with literary criticism are, first, that it made certain
> assumptions about the forms of "authentic" prophecy, which may not hold true,
> and second that it devalues much of what we find in the prophetic books.[^11]

[^11]:
    McConville, The Prophets_, xviii.

> Modern literary conventions forbid plagiarism, and require authors to identify
> and acknowledge any material they have borrowed from another writer. But in
> ancient times it was common to "write" a book by transcribing existing
> material, adapting and adding to it from other documents as required, and not
> indicating which parts were original and which borrowed.[^12]

[^12]:
    John Barton, "Source Criticism: Old Testament," in Freedman, _The Anchor
    Yale Bible Dictionary_, 6:162.

A good description of source criticism comes from _Social & Historical
Approaches ot the Bible_ in the Lexham Method series:

> The dean's office of any university will tell you that plagiarism is a problem
> on campus. Plagiarism has always been a temptation for students, but the
> internet has made finding and copying sources possible with the click of a
> mouse. When a professor grades a cut-and-pasted paper, she can often easily
> recognize the presence of different sources. The first clue that the material
> is not original to the student is usually that it outsmarts the student; that
> is, the professor knows that Student X does not have the mastery of language
> and material evident in the paper. Other clues are the "seams" between stolen
> sources; when certain paragraphs differ significantly from others in style and
> syntax, they most likely came from another source (probably the student). The
> same internet at the disposal of the student is at the disposal of the
> professor, who&mdash;through a Google search of phrases and clauses&mdash;can
> often determine what sources the student used to put together the paper. The
> student may have failed, but the professor has successfully carried out a
> modern version of source criticism.[^13]

    Historical Approaches to the Bible_, ed. Douglas Mangum and Amy Balogh, vol.
    3 of _Lexham Methods Series_ (Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2016), 55.

Examples of source-critical issues are the notion of multiple Isaiahs ("As for
the book of Isaiah, most critical scholarship assumes two or three sources,
though some evangelical critical scholars continue to advocate for a single
author. For the most part, Isaiah studies have moved past the source-critical
debate."[^14]), the _documentary hypothesis_ (briefly addressed below under "My
Thoughts"), and the theory of a hypothetical document containing the sayings of
Jesus known as _Q_ which is suggested as having been used in addition to Mark by
Matthew and Luke.

[^14]:
    Balogh, Cole, and Widder, "Source Criticism," 70.

## I.C. Redaction Criticism

Redaction criticism takes up where source criticism leaves off; it builds on the
results of source criticism. Once the sources have been identified, redaction
critics study "the editing process, whereby the sources have been linked
together and incorporated into the present, finished text"[^15]). Another way to
put it is that the source critic dismantles the text into distinct pieces while
the redaction critic puts these pieces back together into a whole.[^16]

[^15]:
    Barton, "Source Criticism: Old Testament," 162.

[^16]:
    "The job of the source critic is to scientifically and artfully dismantle
    ancient texts, then to categorize and describe the pieces. This is one stage
    in the assembly line of biblical studies. From there, a different criticism
    must be applied in order to put the pieces back together and describe the
    whole." (Balogh, Cole, and Widder, "Source Criticism," 96.)

> Redaction criticism is the prevailing type of criticism in modern scholarly
> writing on the prophets. It is different from literary and form criticism
> because it is interested in principle in the formation of the books up to
> their final form. It recognizes that the words of prophets have been recast
> into new contexts, and so given new meanings. And it assumes that these new
> contexts and meanings are as important and interesting as any original ones.
> Redaction criticism has two aspects, therefore: the study of the stages of a
> book's growth, and the study of the finished work itself, with all the inner
> relationships between its parts that have been produced by the process.[^17]

[^17]:
    McConville, _The Prophets_, xviii.

One of the constants of the academic world is that there are always dissenting
opinions and redaction criticism is not without its detractors. John Van Seters
questioned some of the assumptions of redaction criticism:

> Van Seters contends that the very notion of editors and editions, redactors
> and redaction, developed only in the print and book culture that grew out of
> the Renaissance. As a result, he regards the application of these terms and
> the modern ideas they thus import into the biblical world as grossly
> anachronistic. Van Seters insists biblical writers must be treated solely as
> authors and not as redactors. As authors, these writers may have drawn on
> earlier materials, but they did so in such a way that those materials are
> entirely subverted to the purposes of the new work. Thus, Van Seters would
> argue that the Yahwist is no more an editor or redactor than is Homer or
> Herodotus&mdash;authors surely&mdash;who nevertheless draw on earlier source
> material.[^18]

    to the Bible_, ed. Douglas Mangum and Amy Balogh, vol.  3 of _Lexham Methods

## I.D. Form Criticism

> Form criticism is a study of forms of speech as used in specific settings. It
> was applied with great success to the Psalms, where a setting could be readily
> identified (Israel's worship), and where a number of recurring elements
> suggested that Psalms could be classified into a small number of types.[^19]

[^19]:
    McConville, _The Prophets_, xviii.

> An approach that classifies biblical texts by formal features such as genre
> and connects them with an original social setting. Assumes biblical material
> may have developed from oral sources.[^20]

[^20]:
    Gretchen Ellis, "Form Criticism," in _Social & Historical Approaches to the
    Bible_, ed. Douglas Mangum and Amy Balogh, vol.  3 of _Lexham Methods
    Series_ (Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press, 2016), 102.

Initially, form criticism focused on two key concepts:

* _Gattung_ &ndash; a German term meaning something like _genre_.[^21]

* _Sitz im Leben_ &ndash; another German term usually translated as "situation
  in life" or similar.[^22]

[^21]:
    "A conventional pattern that can be discerned in oral or written material".
    (Ellis, "Form Criticism," 104.)

[^22]:
    "The phrase 'social context' better describes the underlying concept, but it
    is not commonly used in form criticism." (Ellis, "Form Criticism," 104.)

Contemporary form critics (such as George Coats and Marvin Sweeney) purportedly
take a more literary approach, focusing more on the study of genre than social
context.[^23] [^24]

[^23]:
    Cf. Ellis, "Form Criticism", 113ff.

[^24]:
    "In OT studies, form criticism is still very much an actively used
    methodology, though it has changed shaped in recent decades to become more
    closely associated with rhetorical and literary criticisms." (Ellis, "Form
    Criticism," 132.)

There are other branches of criticism that I haven't addressed here. Two that
I'm aware of are tradition-historical criticism and social-scientific criticism,
and I'm sure there are others. I had to draw the line somewhere and, based on
what I have read in the introductions to various commentaries on Amos, the
methods of criticism I discussed above are the most likely to come up in this
series. Naturally, I reserve the right to be completely wrong about this.

## I.E. My Thoughts

During my brief stint at the Bible College of South Australia, I came into
contact with what is known as the _Documentary Hypothesis_, a product of source
and redaction criticism where four sources are identified in the Pentateuch or
Torah:

* J &ndash; Yahwist source (or Jehovist)

* E &ndash; Elohist source (or Elohistic)

* D &ndash; Deuteronomic source

* P &ndash; Priestly source (or Pesher, e.g., in the ABD)

After an initial shock, I wasn't too bothered by the idea that the first five
books of the Bible were edited, compiled or augmented by someone other than
Moses[^25] (even someone many years later) but by the conclusion that was drawn,
that it "[showed] a progression in Israel's theology from animism, to
henotheism, and finally to monotheism"[^26]). The Documentary Hypothesis was
initially suggested by Julius Wellhausen (or at least popularised) in his book
_Prolegomena to the History of Israel_.

[^25]:
    On a side note: I think we need to do a better job at letting people know
    what is said about the Bible so that they're not shocked to the point of
    rejecting the whole faith when they learn these things.

[^26]:
    Tremper Longman III and Raymond B. Dillard, _An Introduction to the Old
    Testament_, 2nd ed. (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, 2007), 43.

Wellhausen proposed the following dates for the four sources:

* J &ndash; mid-tenth century BC

* E &ndash; mid-ninth century BC

* D &ndash; late-seventh century BC

* P &ndash; end of the sixth century BC

> Drawing heavily from the work of his predecessors, Wellhausen's primary thesis
> is that the Mosaic law (i.e., the formation of the covenant community at Mount
> Sinai) was not the starting point of Israel's history, but rather a later
> fabrication that served as the starting point of Judaism, the religious
> community that emerged out of the exile.[^27]

[^27]:
    Balogh, Cole, and Widder, "Source Criticism," 71.

I don't see how a Christian can accept Wellhausen's conclusions that the Mosaic
law was "a later fabrication" and, as "it remains the main theory regarding the
composition of the Pentateuch" I can see why some are not easily able to see the
value of biblical criticism. The Documentary Hypothesis has undergone many
adjustments since Wellhausen:

> Wellhausen's paradigm for understanding ancient Israel continues to be widely
> influential even where his specific conclusions are rejected, and with his
> breakthrough in Pentateuchal source criticism the modern era of OT study
> begins.[^28]

[^28]:
    Barton, "Source Criticism: Old Testament," 162.

> However, there is no real consensus about the Documentary Hypothesis in modern
> scholarship; even among those who hold to the viewpoint, there is a great
> variation in how the theoretical sources are understood, divided, and how many
> sources there are.
>
> Current opinions on the composition of the Pentateuch vary widely, from
> affirming traditional Mosaic authorship to complex theories involving multiple
> sources being woven together over centuries of textual transmission.
> Nonetheless, J, E, D, and P are still often used as convenient labels for
> identifying different types of content in the Pentateuch, apart from questions
> of sources or authorship.[^29]

[^29]:
    Duane Garrett, "The Pentateuch," in _Faithlife Study Bible_, ed. John D.
    Barry, et al. (Bellinghham, WA: Lexham Press, 2012, 2016), 35.

It is apparent that, while various forms of Wellhausen's Documentary Hypothesis
continue to be held by many (perhaps most) scholars, accepting the conclusion
that various sources were used in the composition of the Pentateuch does not
necessarily mean one must adopt Wellhausen's other conclusions. Various
weaknesses in the Documentary Hypothesis have been suggested[^30][^31] and there
are potentially valid alternatives which I won't go into here. Thus, one need
not be as alarmed by Wellhausen's conclusions as I was when I first encountered
them; like other areas of research and scholarship, one should avoid the trap of
thinking a matter is settled (no matter how emphatically people say that it is)
and, of course, as Christians, we need have no fear of the facts.[^32]

[^30]:
    "The hypothesis says that the Pentateuch must be made up of different
    sources because it contains repetition and contradiction. However, the
    hypothesis supposes that the separate sources that make up the Pentateuch do
    not contain repetition or contradiction: that non-contradiction and
    non-repetition are the chief criteria for distinguishing a source. But when
    the sources were combined together, a repetitious and contradictory account
    was produced. But Whybray thinks this is odd. It presupposes that Hebrew
    writing practices changed drastically. Early writers did not tolerate
    contradition or repetition, but later writers accepted it easily. But why
    did their attitudes change? If later writers did not mind repetition, why
    should we suppose earlier Hebrew writers did? But if the earlier writers,
    like the later ones, did not mind contradiction or repetition, how can we
    separate out the sources?" [Gordon J. Wenham, _The Pentateuch_. Vol 1 of
    _Exploring the Old Testament_ (London: Society for Promoting Christian
    Knowledge, 2003), 175.]

[^31]:
    "The challenge form criticism presents for source criticism and, by
    implication, redaction criticism, lies in its contention that much of the
    development of the biblical traditions took place _prior_ to being written.
    Indeed, various Scandinavian scholars, such as Johannes Pedersen and Ivan
    Engnell, placed such heavy emphasis on the oral development of traditions
    that they rejected outright the literary model associated with Wellhausen.
    While most have stopped short of the conclusions reached by the so-called
    Scandinavian school, it remains the case that 'tradition history'
    (Überlieferungsgeschichte), another method that developed out of form
    criticism, attributes to the oral phase of a tradition's development much of
    the shaping and supplementation that redaction criticism would regard as a
    literary enterprise." (Leonard, "Redaction Criticism," 170.)

[^32]:
    "Outside the academy, source criticism's influence continunes to grow,
    albeit slowly. As more and more clergy, leaders, and laypeople learn about
    the Bible from an academic perspective, more perspectives on the Bible are
    shaped by the basic tenets of source crriticism. Of course one would be
    hard-pressed to find a church or synagogue that preaches Wellhausen, Duhm,
    or Griesbach, but the understanding of the biblical text that stems from
    their work has been part of the fabric of theological training in the West
    for decades." (Balogh, Cole, and Widder, "Source Criticism," 97.)

To the Christian uneducated in the ways of biblical criticism, various
conclusions drawn by redaction critics can be alarming: multiple Isaiahs;
multiple Jeremiahs; oral, fragmentary, documentary hypotheses for various
sources in the Pentateuch; an unknown source for some gospels; etc. Certainly at
times some scholars' application of these conclusions challenges and subverts
the Christian faith. For example:

> One explanation for these contradictory promises concerning the future of the
> Davidic dynasty is that of Frank Cross, who argues that DtrH was produced in
> two editions. The first edition, which Cross maintains was written before the
> exile to support Josiah's reforms, culminated in 2 Kings 23:25a: "Before him
> [Josiah] there was no king like him, who turned to the LORD with all his
> heart, with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of
> Moses."
>
> But when Josiah died tragically by Neco's arrow and subsequent kings allowed
> his reforms to flounder, the Davidic dynastic was crushed, and the nation went
> into exile. It was in exile, Cross argues, that a redactor updated the first
> edition of the Deuteronomistic History (Dtr<sup>1</sup>), expanding earlier
> warnings to encompass the dynasty's fall and the nation's destruction and thus
> producing a second version of the history (Dtr<sup>2</sup>).[^33]

[^33]:
    Leonard, "Redaction Criticism," 174&ndash;175.

I have no idea what Cross's convictions were. Until I read these paragraphs
about his work, I'd never even heard of him. His conclusions seem to give the
author a purely sociological motivation ("to support Josiah's reforms") and
suggest that the reason for the exile was added after the fact. Now, this need
not necessarily be a problem; God could have inspired the writer to produce a
document that spurred the people on to follow him as they should, and it could
have been the grace of God to give them a reason for the exile while they were
experiencing it or after they had returned. The application one draws from
Cross's conclusions depends, I think, on whether one believes God is real, that
he interacts with his world and that he is behind the Bible. One could take a
purely sociological approach (humans wrote for human reasons), one could take a
purely spiritual approach (God wrote for God's reasons), or one could take some
hybrid of the two (e.g., humans wrote by God's direction for God's reasons which
were beneficial to humans).

For me, the text is still authoritative and meaningful regardless of how the
final form came to be. Where these branches of criticism are able to help us
understand the intended meaning of the text and thus apply it appropriately to
our lives, they can be very helpful. Like any area of study, Biblical criticism
seems to hinge on the assumptions one brings to the text. In different hands the
same set of facts can produce vastly different conclusions.

I approach the Bible as scripture, breathed out by God; this forms my base
assumption and I draw conclusions with this axiom firmly in place. Others do not
have this axiom and will draw different conclusions because they are operating
either with different facts or from a different starting point. I don't approach
studying the Bible from a scholarly perspective but from a devotional
perspective, though I believe that academic study of the Bible has the potential
to yield great benefits for the devotional reader. As a result, I'll be more
inclined toward simple theories that maintain the unity of the books given to
us, but I will not be overly concerned in most cases if this is not possible.

I am not disquieted by any facts or the many theories about the Bible that
occupy the minds of scholars (usually it seems we're working more in the realm
of theories than facts). I approach the Bible with an inquisitive mind that
looks to God as the ultimate source of truth. When I come to questions that I
cannot answer simply or quickly, I am comfortable with not knowing, but I am
also willing to pursue possible solutions at length (where my interest is high
enough). Put another way, I'm not usually troubled by being on the way to truth,
I don't need to always have matters settled in my mind and I enjoy the process
of learning and discovering new things.

Thus,l unless there is a good reason not to, I will likely take the opinion of
the scholars that I read. I'll mostly be reading evangelical scholars and so I
may end up out of step with the larger academic community, but as always, I'll
be relying on the authors I read to be operating in good faith and interacting
with at least the most compelling or popular dissenting viewpoints.

## I.F. Biblical Criticism and Amos

### I.F.1. Textual Criticism

The following excerpt from Gary Smith's commentary on Amos has several examples
of textual critical arguments:

> The Hebrew text of Amos is fairly well preserved. Several difficulties with
> the Hebrew text do exist. Amos 2:7 and 8:4 have a word from the root _šāʾāp_
> (‘desire’), but the context seems to demand _šûp_ (‘crush’). The problem may
> be scribal or a variant spelling. Confusion between _aleph_ and _ayin_ caused
> a form of _t‘b_ (‘abhor’) to be written _t’b_ (‘desire’) in 6:8. A s probably
> should be replaced by a _ś_ in _mśrp_ (‘corpse-burner’) in 6:10, while _r’b
> bāʾēš_ (‘contend by fire’) might be better rendered _reb’b ʾēš_ (‘rain of
> fire’) in 7:4. Amos 3:12 and 6:12 make better sense if the word division is
> adjusted slightly and 8:8 has ‘as light’ for ‘as the Nile’. The Dead Sea
> Scrolls readings in 5QAmos 1:3–5 present some variations that seem to be
> closer to the Old Greek, but the Masoretic text seems to be more original.
> [^34]

[^34]:
    Gary V. Smith, _Amos_, Mentor (Fearn, Ross-shire, Great Britain: Mentor,
    1998), 18&ndash;19.

Another example of textual criticism from Amos:

> When, for example, we read in the RSV of Amos 6:12, "Do horses run upon rocks?
> Does one plow the sea with oxen?" we must not suppose that the words "the
> sea", which are not given in KJV or RV, represent some different reading from
> the traditional one. They are simply the result of dividing the Hebrew letters
> differently. This re-division of the letters greatly improves the grammar and
> the sense. Amos is evidently asking two questions, both of which demand an
> emphatic "No" for answer.[^35]

[^35]:
    Bruce, _Understanding Biblical Criticism_, ch. 3.

For Amos 6:12a, the KJV has "Shall horses run upon the rock? Will one plow there
with oxen?" while the RSV has (as Bruce quoted above) "Do horses run upon rocks?
Does one plow the sea with oxen?" For the sake of completeness, I'll add that
the NIV has "Do horses run upon the rocky crags? Does one plow the sea with
oxen?"

### I.F.2. Redaction Criticism

One uncontroversial (I think) example of an editor's work in Amos comes in the
first verse:

> The words of Amos, one of the shepherds of Tekoa&mdash;the vision he saw
> concerning Israel two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of
> Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel. (Amos 1:1, NIV)

What marks this as the work of an editor? "[It] is composed in the third person
and stands outside the prophet's oracles as a marker of the collection that
follows"[^36].

[^36]:
    Leonard, "Redaction Criticism," 182.

Scholars' views on Amos range from attributing "most or all of the sayings in
the book to Amos"[^37] to thinking that "only parts of it may have originated
with him, and other parts were added at later times"[^38].

[^37]:
    McConville, _The Prophets_, 165.

[^38]:
    ibid.

> Wolff finds six stages in the formation of the book:
>
> 1. Amos’s oracles (including much of chapters 3–6);
> 2. the first collection of these into ‘cycles’ (the vision-reports in 7:1–8;
>    8:1–2; 9:1–4, and the Oracles Against the Nations were collected and added
>    to the sayings in chapters 3–6);
> 3. the work of a ‘school’ of his disciples (responsible for some of the
>    third-person references to Amos, as in 1:1a; 7:10–17);
> 4. a reinterpretation of the Bethel sayings in Josiah’s time (e.g. 3:14b;
>    5:6);
> 5. a Deuteronomistic redaction (also Josianic), stressing that Judah and
>    Jerusalem are under Yahweh’s judgement (e.g. 2:4–5), and showing an
>    interest in prophecy (2:11–12);
> 6. a post-exilic eschatological addition in 9:11–15 (Wolff 1977, pp.
>    106–13).[^39]

> It is therefore in the highest degree unreasonable to doubt that Amos himself
> committed his message to writing and himself edited it into its present
> coherent and cogent form.[^40]

[^40]:
    J. A. Motyer, _The Message of Amos: The Day of the Lion_, ed. J. A. Motyer
    and Derek Tidball, The Bible Speaks Today (England: Inter-Varsity Press,
    1984), 19.

It is not clear to me that any significant parts of the book of Amos must have
been written by someone other than Amos (or at least someone closely associated
with the prophet), but it is certainly a possibility and regardless, I will need
to think about how to respond to these ideas as there is so much evidence that
the books we have for certain other prophets were the work of later
redactors.[^41]

[^41]:
    "In studying the prophets we cannot avoid the 'book.' Indeed, 'The Prophets'
    in the title of this volume refers to a divison of the canon of the Old
    Testament. When we look for Jeremiah, what we find is a book that tells us
    about Jeremiah and the things he did and said. The book was written (finally
    at least) by someone other than Jeremiah, for a time and place other than
    his own. And a number of the prophets are much more elusive than Jeremiah.
    (How often, when introducing one or other of the prophetic books, I have had
    to say: 'Very little is known about x'!). [McConville, _The Prophets_, xii.]

The belief that God called and spoke through the prophets is not in conflict
with the idea that the books as we now have them were composed by later editors
and perhaps even had multiple versions along the way. If we are comfortable
saying that God inspired the prophets, then it is no problem to say that God
inspired whatever editors or redactors worked on the text. Christians accept
their various canons of scripture as the work of inspiration just as much as the
individual books.

### I.F.3. Form Criticism

Due to time constraints, I was not able to delve very deeply into form criticism
in relation to Amos. The example of modern form-critical scholarship given in
Gretchen Ellis' section on form criticism in the Lexham Methods Series was _The
Forms of the Old Testament Literature_ series which, unfortunately, is yet to
see a published volume on Amos.

Ellis did, however, give a helpful overview of how form criticism has interacted
with the OT prophets generally:

> As noted above, form-critical work on the prophetic books focuses on prophetic
> formulas or the similar patterns on prophetic messages. Form critics emphasize
> that the traditional verse and chapter divisions in prophetic books do not
> always correspond to the actual shift in subject matter. Moreover, as with
> many narrative genres, prophetic literature was originally spoken, rather than
> written. It was only later as prophecy evolved, that a preference for long,
> written speeches developed, as in Ezekiel and Isaiah 40&ndash;55.[^42]

[^42]:
    Ellis, "Form Criticism," 128.

Form criticism has identified several unique forms or genres in the OT prophets:

* Prophetic accounts
* Prayers to Yahweh
* Speeches (including messenger speeches)
* Vision reports
* Vocational accounts
* Woe oracles

See Ellis's discussion for more information. I can see how categorising the text
into these genres can aid in interpretation but it remains to be seen exactly
what insights emerge from this sort of a study.


# II. Date and Historical Background of Amos

Most of what I read suggested that Amos was written some time during the early
to mid eighth century BC.

> Amos' travels from his native Judah into Israel took place in the first half
> of the eighth century BC, when Jeroboam II (786&ndash;746 BC) was Israel's
> king.
>
> In the final half of his tenure (i.e., the 760s and 750s), Israel reached what
> was probably its height in terms of economic prosperity. [^43]

[^43]:
    Douglas Stuart, _Hosea&ndash;Jonah_, Word Biblical Commentary 31 (Dallas:
    Word, Incorporated, 2002), 283.

It is generally accepted that Amos was among the first of the Old Testament
prophets. The following table shows possible dates for the kings of Israel and
Judah and the prophets.[^44]

[^44]:
    McConville, _The Prophets_, viii.

| Kings of Israel        | Kings of Judah      | Prophets                   |
|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Jeroboam II  (786–746) | Uzziah (783–742)    |  Amos (Jonah)              |
| Zechariah (746–745)    |                     |                            |
| Shallum (745)          |                     | Hosea                      |
| Menahem  (745–738)     | Jothan (742–735)    |                            |
| Pekahiah (738–737)     |                     |                            |
| Pekah (737–732)        | Ahaz (735–715)      | Isaiah, Micah              |
| Hoshea (732–722)       |                     |                            |
|                        | Hezekiah (715–687)  |                            |
|                        | Manasseh (687–642)  |                            |
|                        | Amon (642–640)      |                            |
|                        | Josiah (640–609)    | Habakkuk, Nahum, Zephaniah |
|                        | Jehoahaz (609)      | Jeremiah                   |
|                        | Jehoiakim (609–597) | Obadiah                    |
|                        | Jehoiachin (597)    |                            |
|                        | Zedekiah (597–587)  | Ezekiel, Joel?             |

Israel had reached its height "in terms of economic prosperity" in the latter
half of the reign of Jeroboam II.[^45] As usual, when prosperity comes to a
society, it doesn't come for all and so, in the same society where people have
multiple houses and every body desire met, there is extreme poverty and abuse:
"They sell the innocent for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals. They
trample on the heads of the poor as on the dust of the ground and deny justice
to the oppressed. Father and son use the same girl and so profane my holy name."
(Amos 2:6&ndash;8, NIV)

[^45]:
    "In the final half of his tenure (i.e., the 760s and 750s), Israel reached
    what was probably its height in terms of economic prosperity." [Stuart,
    _Hosea–Jonah_, 283.]


# III. Authorship and Composition of Amos

See _I.F.2. Redaction Criticism_.


# IV. The Message of Amos

Naturally, I'll delve into the message of Amos more once we get stuck into the
text, but as I was going through it over the last two weeks, I was struck by how
applicable some passages are to us today:

> "On the day I punish Israel for her sins,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will destroy the altars of Bethel;  
> the horns of the altar will be cut off  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fall to the ground.  
> I will tear down the winter house  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with the summer house;  
> the houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the mansions will be demolished,"  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declares the LORD. (Amos
> 3:14–15, NIV)

> You lie on beds adorned with ivory  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lounge on your couches.  
> You dine on choice lambs  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fattened calves.  
> You strum away on your harps like David  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and improvise on musical instruments.  
> You drink wine by the bowlful  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and use the finest lotions,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.  
> Therefore you will be among the first to go into exile;  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your feasting and lounging will end. (Amos 6:4–7, NIV)  

I love getting into the details, but sometimes get lost in the weeds. In the
preface to Robert Chisholm Jr.’s _Handbook on the Prophets_, I received a
beautiful reminder of the true value of studying the Bible:

> The prophetic literature of the Hebrew Bible presents great interpretive
> obstacles. Its poetry, though teeming with vivid imagery that engages the
> imagination and emotions, challenges the reader’s understanding because of its
> economy of expression, rapid shifts in mood, and sometimes cryptic allusions.
> The reader of the prophetic literature quickly realizes that these books were
> written at particular points in time to specific groups of people with whom
> the modern reader seems to share little. Yet these books are more than just
> ancient documents written to a long-dead people. They contain the very word of
> the eternal God, the message of which transcends time and space. Like the
> ancient prophets, we too worship this God, and, through the mystery of
> inspiration, their words can provide us insight into God’s character and
> challenge us to love him more and to serve him with greater devotion.[^46]
