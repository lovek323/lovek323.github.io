# I. Introduction

From 1:3, Amos has been closing in on Israel.

1. First, nations from Israel’s political environment:
  - Syria (1:3–5)
  - Philistia (1:6–8)
  - Tyre (1:9–10)

2. Then, Israel’s historical cousins:
  - Edom (1:11–12)[^1]
  - Ammon (1:13–15))[^2]
  - Moab (2:1–3)

3. Then, Israel’s brother, Judah (2:4–5)

4. Finally, Israel herself (2:6–16)[^3]

I looked at this briefly in my post on Amos 1, but now that we turn our focus to
Judah ans Israel, it’s worth repeating: the ‘ground of accusation is never
simply that they have acted to the detriment of Israel’[^4]. This is important
because Judah and Israel seem to have taken God’s choice of them as his people,
God’s choice to make his dwelling in Jerusalem, as a licence to do whatever they
felt like.

In this post, I’ll be looking at the oracles against Judah and Israel in Amos
2:4–16. I’ll focus on what these oracles have to say to Christians today.[^5]

[^1]:
    ‘Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country,
    famished. He said to Jacob, “Quick, let me have some of that stew! I’m
    famished!” (That is why he was also called Edom.’ (Genesis 25:29f)

[^2]:
    ‘So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father. The older
    daughter had a son, and she named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites
    today. The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi; he
    is the father of the Ammonites of today.’ (Genesis 19:36–38)

[^3]:
    ‘The first three nations reviewed, Syria, Philistia and Tyre, belonged to
    Israel’s political environment and nothing more. But in the biblical view of
    things the next three, Edom (_cf._ Gn. 25:29f), Ammon and Moab
    (_cf._ Gn.  19:36–38), were “cousins” to Israel: divine judgment was
    now falling, so to say, within the family.’ (Alec Motyer, _The Message of
    Amos,_ ed. Alec Motyer, The Bible Speaks Today [1984; repr., Nottingham,
    England: InterVarsity Press, 2011], 50; repr. of _The Day of the Lion_
    [Nottingham, England: InterVarsity Press, 1974])

[^4]:
    ‘It is appropriate to notice here that in condemning these nations—both the
    outright heathen and the related heathen—the ground of accusation is never
    simply that they have acted to the detriment of Israel.’ (ibid., 50)

[^5]:
    I will not engage with questions of the source and unity of Amos in this
    post. I may look at it in future posts, though I make no promises. For those
    who would like to read about this, Smith’s ‘Unity’ section is well written
    and provides a good starting point. (See Gary V. Smith,
    _Amos,_ rev. and exp. ed. [Ross-shire, Scotland, UK:
    Christian Focus Publications, 1998; repr., 2017], 110–14; repr. of
    _Amos_ [Grand Rapids, MI, USA: Zondervan Publishing House, 1989])

# III. Judah and Israel

## 1. The Oracle Against Judah

The preceding oracles (1:3–2:3) reference crimes of conscience. There were no
written rules that the nations were breaking, the focus was instead on the
unwritten rules written on people’s consciences. The Judahites had the same
requirements and may have been guilty of similar crimes but they also had God’s
law and so they would be judged by that as well. My focus in this post is mainly
the oracle against Judah, but I think the other oracles set the scene for the
oracle against Israel: they gradually gain more and more acceptance of the
standards that God uses to judge: the Israelites and the Judahites had the same
God-given consciences as the other nations; the Israelites had the same law as
Judah.

> On the other hand, the oracles against the earlier nations are more specific,
> in that the specific rebellious acts are given. This shift emphasizes Judah’s
> responsibility to God by contrasting their action with the high standards that
> God revealed to them. The other nations were judged on the basis of common
> sense and a popular sense of morality, while Judah had the statutes and laws
> which guided them.[^6]

As Amos moves from the surrounding nations to Judah, the charges become more
specific. Judah has ‘rejected the law of the <span class="textsc" >Lord</span>’
they have ‘not kept his decrees.’ Finally, we are told they ‘have been led
astray by false gods, / the gods their ancestors followed.’

### Law

In our contemporary context, the word ‘law’ carries with it ‘related ideas of
legalism, enforcement, reward, and punishment’,[^7] which is not quite how the
original readers would likely have understood it. For them, ‘law’ would have
meant ‘“instruction”, with the related idea of a personal contact between
teacher and pupil.’ It was a relational term, the type of instruction that is
given personally by a teachers to their students, not the type of instruction
that is handed down impersonally from a government to its citizens. It is
fitting, then, that Amos reminds the Israelites of their time in the wilderness
after the law had been given when God was with them and led them. This law is
not the law of a distant God who delivers a set of edicts one must obey but the
law of a loving father who instructs his children in the right way to live for
their own benefit.

> of a personal contact between teacher and pupil. The Lord’s law implies His
> personal drawing near as teacher and the establishment of a personal
> relationship between Him and the one to whom He purposes to impart his
> truth.[^8]

### Liars

The NIV translators made an interpretive decision when they translated verse 4c
as ‘they have been led astray by false gods, / the gods their ancestors
followed.’ The original text simply says ‘lies,’ not ‘false gods.’ Smith
translates the phrase ‘but their liars led them astray, / the ones after which
their fathers went’,[^9] noting that ‘the Old Greek translated “their liars”
with “their follies, idols” and adds “which they have made” which is not in the
Hebrew.’

> The final lines of 2:4 are sometimes interpreted to refer to Judah’s worship
> of ‘false gods, or idols’. On the basis of this interpretation, a specific sin
> against Judah is identified, but it is a crime against Yahweh rather than a
> social sin as in the earlier oracles. But the root meaning of _kzb_ means ‘to
> lie’, and there is no other case in Deuteronomy (or the rest of Hebrew
> scripture) where this root clearly means ‘false gods, idols’. The prophets do
> describe the people as being ‘led astray’ by the ‘lies’ (_kzb_) of the false
> prophets and leaders of the nation (Isa. 3:12; 9:15–16; 28:15; Mic. 3:5; Jer.
> 23:14, 32). These leaders deceived the people of Judah and caused perversion
> in the moral, civil, ceremonial, and personal behavior or attitudes of the
> people.[^10]

There is clearly some debate about this and I have no skills, training or
experience in reading or understanding Hebrew, but it seems to me that ‘liars,’
referring to leaders who have led Israel astray is the appropriate reading of
these verses. The ESV, HCSB, KJV, NLT, and NRSV all translate this part of verse
4 as ‘liars’ with the NIV being the only translation I looked at rendering it as
‘false gods.’ I think what we see here is a nation that has gradually abandoned
God’s plan through following poor leaders.

## 2. The Oracle Against Israel

The oracle against Israel in verses 6–16 can be divided into three parts:

1. The standard formula – ‘For three sins of Israel, even for four, I will not
   relent’ followed by a list of the sins that led to this judgement

2. A reminder of what God has done – they are God’s special people, they have
   received many blessings and benefited from divine favour

3. A description of the coming judgement – it is inescapable

The first six oracles against the nations surrounding Judah and Israel consisted
of accusations of immorality against other people. As I discussed in the post on
Amos 1, God is holding them to a general standard common to all people. In Amos
2, when the prophet’s attention is turned to Judah and then to Israel, we see
that they are being held to account not only for sins against this general
standard everyone is expected to know and respect, but also for sins against the
more specific standard, the standard God revealed to them and for sins against
God. Judah, it says, ‘rejected the law of the <span class="textsc" >Lord</span>’
(v. 4) and Israel profaned God’s holy name (v. 7).[^11]

In verses 9–12, Amos retells some of the things God has done for his people:

- He destroyed the Amorites who occupied the land before them (v. 9)
- He brought them out of Egypt (v. 10)
- He was with them, cared for them, led them through the wilderness (v. 10)
- He gave them the land (v. 10)
- He never abandoned them, left them to their own devices, he raised up prophets
  and Nazirites (holy people) from among them (v. 11)

One of the key topics in Amos is, I think, the idea of privilege. God’s people
had a unique privilege – they had the law, they had instructions from God, they
knew what was right and what was wrong through more than just their conscience.
The list of what God has done for the Israelites was not simply a reminder that
he was good and worthy of their devotion and obedience. No, as we’re told in
verse 6, God ‘will not relent.’ This wasn’t a call to repentance, this was a
notice of the coming judgment.

When Amos reminded the Israelites that the God whose name they had profaned was
the same God who destroyed the Amorites completely (from fruit to root), he was
reminding them that God is a God of justice, a powerful God who had destroyed a
powerful people before because of the very things the Israelites were now
themselves doing. In Amos 3:2 it says, ‘You only have I chosen / of all the
families of the earth; / therefore I will punish you for all your sins.’ The
fact that they were God’s chosen people didn’t let them off the hook, God
wouldn’t treat them more leniently than the Amorites. On the contrary, because
they had the privileges of being led by him through the wilderness, of having
prophets in their midst, of seeing holiness lived out in the lives of the
Nazirites, of possessing the law, they would be judged more harshly. They
wouldn’t be let off the hook because God had been so good to them, they were all
the more aware of the seriousness of and responsible for their actions because
God had given them every assistance to live rightly and despite all this they
chose to live wrongly.

The list of things God had done for his people in verses 9–12 showed just how
completely they had rejected God’s goodness and provision for them. ‘Whatever
their sins against the voice of conscience, this is no longer in the forefront.
They have passed the point of no return by disregarding and silencing the voice
of revelation.’[^12]

[^11]:
    ‘By agreeing with Amos’ accusations against Judah, the Israelite audience is
    admitting the validity of God’s law as a standard for the judgment of his
    people. Judah knew God’s will (and so did Israel), but she failed to follow
    him. Although failure to follow Yahweh’s law is never specifically mentioned
    in the following oracle against Israel, most agree that the Israelite legal
    code is the backdrop for the accusation against Israel. Therefore, the
    establishment of its authority immediately before the Israelite oracle is
    significant. The specific sins of Israel (2:6–8) are contrary to the
    traditions which Judah and Israel received and the proclamation of the
    prophets (2:11). By getting Israel to support the judgment against Judah on
    the basis of the law of Yahweh, Amos has prepared the nation for God’s word
    against the northern tribes.’ (Smith, _Amos,_ 116)

[^12]:
    Ibid., 109.

## 3. Israeli and Judah Together Under God's Judgement

In 930 BC, Rehoboam began to reign and, as we learn in 1 Kings 12, due to ‘the
repressive measures his father, Solomon, had initiated to fund his building
projects’[^13]

Although Judah and Israel were once one nation, rivalry between the tribes
existed before the reign of David (2 Sam. 2–3), and eventually the nation split
after the death of Solomon (1 Kings 12). Bitterness and mistrust resulted in
open war between the two brother nations (1 Kings 12:18–24; 14:30; 15:7, 16–21,
32; 2 Kings 14:8–14). The introduction of the calves at Bethel and Dan, the
acceptance of Baalism and other cultic innovations (1 Kings 12:28–33) widened
the gap between Judah and Israel.  In many ways the Israelites in Samaria
considered Judah a foreign nation, and the audience probably greeted Amos’
condemnation of Judah with a good deal of pleasure and smug
self-righteousness.[^14]

The ten northern tribes that comprised the nation of Israel and the two southern
tribes that comprised the nation of Judah would be punished for the same reason:
because they were God’s chosen people (with all the blessings and privileges
that came with it) and yet had still sinned, they would be punished.

Though Judah and Israel considered themselves separate nations, the list of
things God had done for the northern nation of Israel applies equally to the
southern tribe of Judah. They had all received the law, they had all seen God
destroy the Amorites, they had all been rescued by God from Egypt, they had all
been with God in the wilderness. As it says in Amos 3:1: ‘Hear this word, people
of Israel, the word the <span class="textsc" >Lord</span> has spoken against
you—against the whole family I brought up out of Egypt’.

# IV. Theological Reflections

## 1. God Doesn't Play Favourites

There is no distinction between the other nations and Israel and Judah. Amos
uses the same phrase to describe the repeated transgressions of Israel as he
used in the earlier oracles: ‘For three sins of Israel, / even for four, I will
not relent.’ (2:4, 6)

Writing in his commentary on Amos, J. A. Motyer says this:

> In the same way, the appeal to conscience, to common humanity, underlying his
> review of the world is another move depriving Israel of any special ground or
> plea. Whatever makes Israel distinct among the nations, there is no
> distinction at this point, that the same moral rules operate inside as
> outside. Thus the noose tightens until, as we shall now see, the unique
> position granted by grace to the church of God, far from excusing or even
> ameliorating the offence, aggravates the situation so that Israel’s fourth
> transgression is even less understandable or forgivable than that of the
> heathen who knew not God. The uniqueness of the church includes its unique
> peril.[^15]

This truth is directly applicable to the church today. We have been redeemed
through the blood of Christ. This is our rescue-from-Egypt story. But the idea
that we can sit back and live however we like is totally incompatible with
everything the Bible teaches through both the Old and New Testaments. It is an
age-old tension – we are the rescued and redeemed people of God but that doesn’t
lessen our responsibility, it increases it.

> ‘I will not vacillate about it’ demonstrates Yahweh’s determination to hold
> Judah responsible for her guilt. His wrath will not cease; the decree will be
> carried out; Judah will be punished for her many rebellious acts. Any
> privilege which Judah enjoyed through her special relationship to God is
> ignored. The possibility of excuse is not even mentioned; instead the
> advantage of Judah increases the weight of her guilt.[^16]

In Luke 12:42ff, Jesus contrasts a ‘faithful and wise manager’ with a ‘servant
who knows the master’s will and &#x2026;does not do what the master wants.’
Jesus said ‘it will be good for [the faithful and wise] servant &#x2026;when
[the master] returns’ but the master ‘will cut [the second servant] to pieces
and assign him a place with unbelievers.’

> ‘The servant who knows the master’s will and does not get ready or does not do
> what the master wants will be beaten with many blows. But the one who does not
> know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From
> everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who
> has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.’ (Luke 12:47–48)

Like Amos, Jesus tells us that knowing the truth isn’t enough. On the contrary,
those who know what the master wants and don’t do it will receive a harsher
punishment. There is no favouritism with God. But what does this mean? Perhaps
there is more to it than this, but I think at least this means that growing up
in a Christian family or learning about the Christian faith without actually
submitting to Jesus as your Lord and God as your master isn’t going to help one
bit. There are plenty of people who call themselves Christians for whom these
must be terrifying verses indeed. For me, they give me pause for thought and I’d
like to continue to try to understand exactly what they mean.

    Smith, _Amos,_ 114–15.

## 2. God's People Are Vulnerable to Lies

In Amos, we see God’s chosen people falling into the sins of the Amorites. We
see a gradual corruption through tradition: ‘because they have been led astray
by false gods, the gods their ancestors followed’ (v. 4). It happened to God’s
people in the Old Testament and we would, I think, be fools to think that it
cannot happen to the church today.

Motyer made two relevant points on this topic:

1. God’s truth (as revealed to us in the Bible) is ‘the safeguard of the church’
   just as much as ‘the church is called by God to safeguard’ it. We are to look
   to the Bible, not to man (no matter how good their theological pedigree) for
   the truth about how we should live. It’s important that we don’t let the idea
   that we are the guardians of the truth drown out the Bible’s ability to speak
   to us and correct our understanding no matter how much tradition is on the
   line. The Bible keeps the Christian safe from bad leadership in the church
   just as much as the church proclaims the truths of the Bible.

   > Here is a very largely forgotten and yet most vital principle. It is
   > certainly the case that the church is called by God to safeguard, publicize
   > and transmit His truth (_e.g._ 2 Tim. 1:13, 14; 2:1, 2); but it is equally
   > the case that the truth is the safeguard of the church, both in the
   > corporate sense of preserving the whole body and in the individual sense of
   > guarding, defending and keeping each member. The life which walks int the
   > truth is impregnable (_cf._ Jn. 8:31, 32, 34–36).[^17]

2. The Bible is not the only source of truth. In Proverbs 6:6, we’re told, ‘Go
   to the ant, you sluggard; / consider its ways and be wise!’ We can look at
   the world God has created and we can listen to the people God has created,
   the people who bear his image, to learn truth. But the instruction God has
   revealed to us in the Bible must be our supreme source of truth. That’s the
   thing we are to base our lives on.

   > Now Amos is not saying that man is incapable of ever unearthing truth. He
   > is not even saying that unless a thing can be verified by Scripture it must
   > be false. He is saying this: when anything other than the Word of God is
   > given the supreme place, so that we base our lives upon it and guide our
   > lives by it, then it becomes a lie and a source of lies. To put it at its
   > best—_i.e._ when ‘tradition’ expresses a truth and not an error—when a part
   > of the truth is taken to be the whole of the truth it becomes an untruth,
   > simply because it is stretched beyond its limit, and becomes warped and
   > altered. And when such a misshapen ‘truth’ is taken as the guide for life,
   > what can it do but mislead?[^18]

I think the words of this oracle, that ‘They have rejected the instruction of
the <span class="textsc" >Lord</span>, / refusing to obey his decrees. / They
have been led astray by the same lies / that deceived their ancestors’ (Amos
2:4b–c, NLT) speak directly into our context today. We need to make sure we
never forget God’s instruction (and the type of instruction it is, i.e.,
_relational_ instruction) and fall victim to the same lies humans have been
deceived by for as long as there have been humans.

    Motyer, _The Message of Amos,_ 54.

[^18]:
    Ibid., 54.


## 3. We Cannot Save Ourselves

Verses 13–15 expand on the coming judgement. Amos corrects any mistaken idea in
the people that there would be hope for escape. God will crush them and nobody
will escape, not the swift, the strong, the warrior, the teacher, the archer,
the fleet-footed soldier, the horseman. The bravest warriors will be humiliated
– they will flee naked on the coming day of judgement.

Niehaus sees hope in verses 13ff and certainly this is in line with God’s
character, but I’m not sure it can be tied back to Amos’ message here.

> In the midst of all this, however, there is ultimate hope. For it is the Lord
> who chastises them. And the Lord is, after all, ‘God the Hero.’ ‘The Lord
> disciplines those whom he loves, / and chastises every child whom he accepts’
> (Heb. 12:6, quoting Prov.  3:12). And he must win the battle.[^19]

Those we rely on for help, those to whom we look to save us will not be able to
do so. Against the punishment of God, all human effort fails.

> It illustrates, along with verses 14–15, the principle there stated, that none
> of the able, skilled, or mighty will be able to do what is expected of them
> when the judgement of Yahweh comes. Indeed, they will not even be able to
> deliver themselves, not to mention making an effective stand against the
> foe.[^20]

# Postscript

One of the things I’ve noticed as I’ve been studying Amos is how much I don’t
yet understand about God’s story. The Old and New Testaments must be understood
as a whole, but I find so many unanswered questions about passages in the New
Testament getting in the way of me understanding the Old. For example, what does
it mean that there is no condemnation for believers (cf. Romans 8:1)? Does it
make Amos’ warnings irrelevant to the Christian? Are they purely of historical
value? Do they reveal the will and heart of God? I haven’t given a lot of
thought to Romans 8:1 but it does seem to be related to Amos’ words that God’s
anger would rage against the Israelites and nothing could turn it away. I’m sure
I’ll understand more things as I continue to engage with God’s word; I’m also
sure I’ll never get to the end, I’ll never know everything. Perhaps when I study
Romans, I’ll find that my ideas about how to interpret Amos were wrong.

Another example of this is the New Testament teaching about obeying secular
authorities in Romans 13 (‘Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities,
for there is no authority except that which God has established.’ [Romans 13:1])
and 1 Peter 2 (‘Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority:
whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority, or to governors, who are sent
by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.’ [1 Peter
2:13]). In Amos 2:4, the Israelites are accused of following poor leaders.
Perhaps there’s some extra context since the nation of Israel and its leaders
were chosen by God in a way that our secular nations are not? I think it quite
likely that it’s a warning against following ungodly leaders in our churches.
