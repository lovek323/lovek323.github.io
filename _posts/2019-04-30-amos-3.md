# I. Introduction

The third chapter of Amos seems to focus on dispelling the Israelites' false
sense of security. I'll touch on most parts of Amos 3, but I'll start with
verses 3&ndash;8 which I found quite confusing on my first reading.

# II. Verses 3&ndash;8

> <sup>3</sup> Do two walk together  
> <span style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"></span>unless they have agreed to do so?  
> <sup>4</sup> Does a lion roar in the thicket  
> <span style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"></span>when it has no prey?  
> Does it growl in its den  
> <span style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"></span>when it has caught nothing?  
> <sup>5</sup> Does a bird swoop down to a trap on the ground  
> <span style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"></span>when no bait is there?  
> Does a trap spring up from the ground  
> <span style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"></span>if it has not caught anything?  
> <sup>6</sup> When a trumpet sounds in a city,  
> <span style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"></span>do not the people tremble?  
> When disaster comes to a city,  
> <span style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"></span>has not the <span class="textsc" >Lord</span> caused it?
>
> <sup>7</sup> Surely the Sovereign <span class="textsc" >Lord</span> does nothing  
> <span style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"></span>without revealing his plan  
> <span style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"></span>to his servants the prophets.
>
> <sup>8</sup> The lion has roared—  
> <span style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"></span>who will not fear?  
> The Sovereign <span class="textsc" >Lord</span> has spoken—  
> <span style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"></span>who can but prophesy?

What on earth do these verses mean? I couldn't work it out by just
looking at it. In certain circles, there seems to be the idea that one
ought to be able to understand the Bible on its own without any external
inputs. I wasn't able to understand these verses &ndash; I couldn't even
really come up with *ideas* about what they might mean &ndash; without
consulting what others have written concerning them.

There were two main interpretations of these verses in the texts I read:

1. Amos is driving home the idea of cause and effect: actions have consequences;
   Amos is defending his message

2. Amos is defending his prophetic office, defending his right to speak,
   defending himself not his message

I'll split this passage up into four sections and deal with each in turn:

1. v. 3

2. vv. 4&ndash;6

3. vv. 6, 8

4. v. 7

## II.1. Verse 3: Walking Together

This is a strange verse, isn't it? The NRSV translates it 'Do two walk together
unless they have made an appointment?' which sounds quite different to my ear.
In my research, this verse was interpreted either as (1) about God and Israel,
or (2) about God and Amos.

Motyer interprets verse 3 as being about God and Israel:

> Two people do not 'keep company' except by making an arrangement. Just such an
> arrangement was made between the Lord and His people at the Exodus and they
> began to 'keep company'.[^1]

Calvin, on the other hand, argues that verse 3 refers to God and his prophet,
Amos:

> Some forcibly misapply the Prophet's words, as though the meaning was, that
> God was constrained to depart from that people, because he saw that they were
> going astray so perversely after their lusts.
>
> &hellip;
>
> The Prophet here affirms that he speaks by God's command, as when two agree
> together, when they follow the same road; as when one meets with a chance
> companion, he asks him where he goes, and when he answers that he is going to
> a certain place, he says, I am going on the same road with you. Then Amos by
> this similitude very fitly sets forth the accordance between God and his
> Prophets.[^2]

I will discuss this more below, but I agree with Motyer et al. that the idea
here is that God and Israel have agreed to 'keep company'. What is the content
of this agreement? The covenant entered into by the Israelites at Mount Sinai.

## II.2. Verses 4&ndash;6: Cause and Effect

Verses 4&ndash;6 are central to our passage and they have been understood as
fitting into one or the other of the overarching interpretations I mentioned
above: either Amos is driving home the truthfulness of his message or Amos is
defending his own authority as God's prophet.

> Verse 8 comes as a climax to a series of verses which proclaim that there is
> no effect without a cause.[^3]

As we saw above, Calvin reads verse 3 as about the relationship between God and
his prophet and not between God and Israel. Calvin sees a slightly different
(perhaps deeper) meaning in these 'similitudes':

* v. 4: 'God does not cry out for nothing by his Prophets'

* v. 5: 'nothing happens without being foreseen by God'

* v. 6: 'the threatenings of God would not be without effect'[^4]

The cause-and-effect pattern that other commentators see[^5] makes a lot
of sense to me in a context where the prophet is trying to convince a
rebellious people that their actions do in fact have consequences not
necessarily because of who God is but more because of the very nature of
things. Calvin's conclusions are more about God (purpose, foresight,
power) than about the nature of things. I don't see the depth of meaning
that Calvin does in these passages, but they are nevertheless true and
at least the first point (that 'God does not cry out for nothing by his
Prophets') is, I think, backed up by other parts of the passage.

[^5]:
    Niehaus sees vv. 3&ndash;6 as having a 'cause-and-effect structure (vv.
    3&ndash;6)', but he admits the that 'it is also the relationship between the
    Lord and his prophet is indicated here \[v. 3\]'. (Jeff Niehaus, 'Amos', in
    *The Minor Prophets: An Exegetical and Expository Commentary,* ed.  Thomas
    E. McComiskey \[1992; repr., Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2009\],
    315&ndash;494)

    Smith sees vv. 1&ndash;8 as addressing the shocking nature of his message:
    'For the nation to respond positively to the word of God concerning the
    destruction of Israel, the prophet must overcome the illogical nature of
    supposing that the God who chose Israel would now destroy her.' (Gary V.
    Smith, *Amos,* rev. and exp. ed. \[Ross-shire, Scotland, UK: Christian Focus
    Publications, 1998; repr., 2017\], 135; repr. of *Amos* \[Grand Rapids, MI,
    USA: Zondervan Publishing House, 1989\]) Smith objects to Calvin's
    viewpoint: 'The significance of 3:3&ndash;8 is all too frequently centered
    around the prophet's justification of himself.' (ibid., 146)

## II.3. Verses 6 and 8: The Appropriate Response

In verses 6 and 8, Amos is talking about two things: (1) the appropriate
response to the current message of disaster (2) the source of the coming
disaster.

In verse 6, Amos says to the people, 'You know what to do when the trumpet
sounds, right? Yes, you tremble in fear.' In verse 8, Amos says to the people,
'The lion *has* roared, you should be afraid.' In verse 6, we're told that this
sort of disaster is caused by God. In verse 8, we're told that Amos' message
(about the coming disaster) comes from God and that he is just the messenger.

## II.4. Verse 7: The Privilege of Knowing God

Verse 7 is a difficult one. We're told that God 'does nothing without revealing
his plan to &hellip; the prophets'. When I read this, I applied my modern,
western analytical mindset and so my first thought is that Amos is saying God
tells every little detail of all of his plans to the prophets. 'But what about
Jesus?' I wonder. I don't think the prophets knew the details of God's future
plan of redemption. Otherwise, as Amos himself says, he would be unable to keep
it to himself ('who can but prophesy?', v. 8).

Perhaps, as some say, it is simply God's normal way of acting[^6] and is not
intended as a statement about every single instance in the way I naturally read
it. I'm not completely satisfied by this explanation, it seems to me to be
watering down Amos' words.

Some see verses 7&ndash;8 as Amos defending his right to speak, defending his
message[^7]. They see it as Amos reminding his audience of how God does in fact
let his prophets in on his secret plans and that Amos is God's messenger, that
Amos is speaking the truth. And this does come through in these verses, but if
we read verses 3&ndash;6 and 8a as Amos driving home the sombre reality that
faces the Israelites, then it makes sense to me for vv. 7&ndash;8a to be serving
the same purpose. In verse 7, Amos is perhaps saying, this is truly a word from
the [Lord]{.textsc}, this is truly a possibility and it fits with the way God
usually delivers this sort of message: he tells his prophets[^8]. A paraphrase
could be, 'Surely the Sovereign [Lord]{.textsc} brings no judgement against his
people without revealing it through his servants the prophets', the fact that a
prophet is delivering this message speaks to the gravity of the situation, it
should not be dismissed.

[^6]:
    'It is God's general plan to anticipate coming events by informing His
    servants the prophets of what He intends to do.' (Motyer, *The Day of the
    Lion,* 73)

[^7]:
    Commenting on verse 7: 'Thus Amos' lesson on cause and effect is a
    substantiation of his role as a prophet.' (Niehaus, 'Amos', 381)

[^8]:
    'It is not that Yahweh does nothing at all without telling the prophets;
    rather, he does nothing by way of covenant-lawsuit judgment without telling
    them.' (ibid., 380)

## II.5. Falling Out of God's Favour

So far as I've been reading Amos, I've been confronted with a persistent
question: Is it really possible for God's chosen people to fall out of his
favour? Motyer says that 'We have forgotten that our God can turn and become our
enemy'.[^9] Now, Motyer is addressing Christians which I'll address in more
detail below, under *Application*, but in terms of Amos' audience, they would
almost certainly have resisted the idea that God would judge and punish his
chosen people. They relied on the promises they had inherited, the promises to
Abraham, for their security.

The second of the two interpretations I listed above &ndash; that Amos is
driving home a dreadful truth &ndash; makes the most sense to me.

In verse 2, we can see that this is Amos' message: '"You only have I chosen / of
all the families of the earth; / therefore I will punish you for all your
sins."' To paraphrase, I think Amos is saying, 'Yes, you are God's people, but
do not think that this means you can't fall out of his favour.' This is a
difficult truth for the people to accept. Verse 3 is Amos saying that, though
the Israelites may think themselves protected no matter what they do, God and
Israel cannot walk together if the agreement that is the basis of their
relationship is ignored. In verses 4&ndash;6, Amos points out the universal
truth that actions have consequences and unfaithfulness to the covenant is no
exception. After reminding the people how cause and effect works, verses 6 and 8
apply this truth to the present unwelcome message: the trumpets have sounded,
the lion has roared, this is from the [Lord]{.textsc}, you should be afraid.

[^9]:
    Alec Motyer, *The Message of Amos,* The Bible Speaks Today (1984; repr.,
    Nottingham, England: InterVarsity Press, 2011), 79; repr. of *The Day of the
    Lion* (Nottingham, England: InterVarsity Press, 1974).

## II.6. What Hope is There?

In chapter 2, God is reported as saying 'For three sins of Israel, even for
four, I will not relent' (2:6). In chapter 3, God says 'I will punish you for
all your sins' (3:2). Is there really no hope?

Calvin thinks there is hope, that God is not announcing the punishment for no
reason, but that so 'that they might in time repent'[^10]. Motyer sees the
question in v. 3 as not assuming the answer 'No', but left intentionally
unanswered with the following questions showing an interim period of hope
between initial cause and final effect[^11]. This 'moment of hope' does not,
however, 'tarry indefinitely'.[^12] Smith says that 'the revelation of God's
decisions to a prophet does not limit God's sovereign freedom to take a contrary
course of action if people repent'.[^13]

I think the answer lies in my general conclusions about these verses: Amos is
driving home an unwelcome truth, that God's judgement is a real possibility for
the covenant community of Israel. Amos' task is to bring this truth to bear, to
explain to the Israelite people that God's promises don't mean they can do
whatever they want. There does seem to be hope: we're in the interim period
where we've heard the lion roar but he hasn't yet attacked his prey. But I agree
with Motyer that the period of grace won't last for ever and so whether God's
judgement of the Israelites delivered through Amos was final with no hope of
repentance or the door was left open for repentance in chapter 3, we still have
to deal with the difficulties: there is a limit to God's grace toward members of
his people who knowingly and willingly flout the covenantal relationship and its
requirements. God will not walk endlessly with those who ignore their agreement
with him.

[^10]:
    'Then he shows that God designedly announces the punishment he would inflict
    on transgressors, that they might in time repent, and that he does not cry
    out for no reason, as unreflecting men grow angry for nothing, but that he
    is driven to anger by just causes and therefore terrifies them by his
    prophets.' (Calvin, *Commentaries on the Twelve Minor Prophets,*
    203&ndash;4)

[^11]:
    v. 4: (a) the lion has his prey, (b) the lion has caught his prey; v. 5: (a)
    the bird is enticed by the bait, (b) the trap has caught the bird; v. 6: (a)
    the trumpet sounds as a warning, (b) the disaster comes.  (Motyer, *The
    Message of Amos,* 71)

    Ibid., 71.

[^13]:
    Smith, *Amos,* 152.

## II.7. Verse 12

> This is what the [Lord]{.textsc} says:
>
> []{style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"}'As a shepherd rescues from the lion's mouth\
> []{style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"}[]{style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"}only two leg bones or a piece of an ear,\
> []{style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"}so will the Israelites living in Samaria be rescued,\
> []{style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"}[]{style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"}with only the head of a bed\
> []{style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"}[]{style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"}and a piece of fabric from a couch.'

You may read this as I did as referring to a *remnant* that God would save. Yes,
the kingdom of Israel would be no more, but the few who were the true Israel,
the people of God would be saved. And while there is, perhaps, an element of
this in the verse[^14], there is an element that muddies the waters a bit: in
Amos' time, if a sheep was killed by a wild beast (such as a lion) the shepherd
would recover whatever he could as proof that he didn't steal the sheep
himself[^15]. There are other parts of Amos, ('so that they may possess the
remnant of Edom and all the nations that bear my name', 9:12a) that support the
remnant idea but it doesn't look like Amos is giving the Israelites this hope in
v. 12. On the contrary, it looks as though he's saying they'll be utterly
destroyed like a sheep by a lion and the customary evidence that this happened
will be all that remains.

[^14]:
    Commenting on verse 12: 'The nation will die and only a few dismal remnants
    of its once proud past will remain.' (Niehaus, 'Amos', 386)

[^15]:
    'When a sheep was killed, the shepherd was required by Israelite law to
    recover the remains and return them to the owner: "If it is torn by a beast,
    let him bring it as evidence" (Exod. 22:10&ndash;13, \[Heb 22:9&ndash;12\])'
    (Smith, *Amos,* 166)

    'The same principle is found in the Code of Hammurabi, a Mesopotamian legal
    code about one thousand years before Amos.' (ibid., 166, footnote)

# III. Application

## III.1. Israel and the Church

I have been thinking a lot about how the Old Testament should be read by
Christians, about what value it has outside of reporting the history of God's
acts in the world. What can we learn from Amos about who God is, what he has
done, who we are and how we should live in light of all this? Essentially, what
is the application of Amos for me, a Christian living in 21st century Australia?
In line with this, I've been trying to understand the relationship between
Israel and the church. I'm still very new to this, there's a lot more I need to
read and learn and think about before I even begin to approach conclusions, but
there are a few things that currently make sense to me and I think shed a good
amount of light.

As I've been thinking about this question, I've found N. T. Wright's *Christian
Origins and the Question of God* series very helpful. In particular the second
and third volumes: *Paul and the Faithfulness of God* and *The New Testament and
the People of God*.

I'll offer a summary of some interesting points I found in these books related
to the relationship of Israel and the church and how I think that helps us read
and apply the Old Testament.

* The Christian family is part of the Israelite family

  > From our earliest evidence, the Christians regarded themselves as a new
  > family, directly descended from the family of Israel, but now
  > transformed.[^16]

* This Christian family saw Israel's history as its own history

  > It \[the eucharist\] occupied a place similar to that of Passover in the
  > Jewish community, except that it was celebrated not just once a year, but at
  > least every week, reflecting the regular celebration of Jesus' resurrection
  > on the first day of the week.  It thus tied the life of early Christianity
  > very firmly to the historical life of Israel. &hellip; We know of no early
  > eucharist that did not recite the events of Jesus' death, much as the
  > Passover liturgy recited the events of the exodus. Eucharist, like baptism,
  > tied together continuity with Jewish history, an implicit claim, *vis-à-vis*
  > the pagan world, and Jesus.[^17]

  > &hellip; what united early Christians, deeper than all diversity, was
  > *that they told, and lived, a form of Israel's story which reached
  > its climax in Jesus and which then issued in their spirit-given
  > new life and task.*[^18]

* Christians see Jesus and his people as replacing the Temple, the Torah, the
  Land and the City

  > No new Temple would replace Herod's, since the real and final replacement
  > was Jesus and his people. No intensified Torah would define this community,
  > since its sole definition was its Jesus-belief. No Land claimed its
  > allegiance, and no Holy City could function for it as Jerusalem did for
  > mainline Jews; Land had now been transposed into World, and the Holy City
  > was the New Jerusalem.[^19]

* Jesus is the fulfilment of Israel's hopes

  > &hellip; when some hitherto frightened and puzzled Jews came to the
  > conclusion that Israel's hope, the resurrection from the dead, the return
  > from exile, the forgiveness of sins, had all come true in a rush in Jesus,
  > who had been crucified.[^20]

* Christians saw themselves as the continuation of Israel, inheriting Israel's
  task

  > Those who now belonged to Jesus' people were not identical with ethnic
  > Israel, since Israel's history had reached its intended fulfilment; they
  > claimed to be the *continuation of Israel in a new situation*, able to draw
  > freely on Israel-images to express their self-identity, able to read
  > Israel's scriptures and apply them to their own life. They were thrust out
  > by that claim, and that reading, to fulfil Israel's vocation on behalf of
  > the world.[^21]

  > Israel is called to a task (in the words of a learned Jewish correspondent,
  > echoing centuries of tradition) of 'repairing the world in God's name'.[^22]

  > Israel is God's *servant*; and the point of having a servant is not that the
  > servant becomes one's best friend, though that may happen too, but in order
  > that, through the work of the servant, one may *get things done*. And what
  > [yhwh]{.textsc} wants done, it seems, is for his glory to extend throughout
  > the earth, for all nations to see and hear who he is and what he has
  > done.[^23]

  > The particular calling of Israel &hellip; would seem to be that *through*
  > Israel, the creator God will bring his sovereign rule to bear on the world.
  >
  > &hellip; since the claim is then made that this vocation, of Israel being a
  > 'light to the nations', has been fulfilled in Jesus the Messiah. &hellip; I
  > think that is exactly what Paul is talking about.[^24]

  > Granted the universality of human sin, as highlighted by the 'apocalypse of
  > the wrath of God' in the gospel (Romans 1:18&ndash;2:16), what is to be
  > done? Step forward the faithful Jew: this is the task of Abraham's family,
  > to be the people through whom all this would be put right.[^25]

* Jesus and his followers were the true Israel in a way that national or ethnic
  Israel weren't

  > Following our exposition &hellip; it should be clear that texts which speak
  > of the 'coming of the son of man on a cloud' have as their obvious
  > first-century meaning the prediction of vindication for the true Israel.
  > Furthermore, from the use of these texts in the synoptic gospels it should
  > be clear that the early Christians believed that Jesus was taking the place
  > of that true Israel.[^26]

  > Within fifty years of the death of Jesus, by the time that Ignatius and
  > Akiba were young men, those who saw themselves as Jesus' followers were
  > claiming that they were the true heirs of the promises made by the creator
  > god to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and that the Jewish scriptures were to be
  > read in terms of a new fulfilment.
  >
  > &hellip; Christianity's claim to be the true tenants of the vineyard was,
  > naturally, resented.[^27]

* Paul's (i.e., Christian) theology doesn't break with Jewish theology, it
  revises or reapplies it

  > &hellip; the hypothesis at the heart of this book is that Paul's thought is
  > best understood in terms of the revision, around Messiah and spirit, of the
  > fundamental categories and structures of second-Temple Jewish understanding;
  > and that this 'revision', precisely because of the drastic nature of the
  > Messiah's death and resurrection, and the freshly given power of the spirit,
  > is no mere minor adjustment, but a radically new state of affairs, albeit
  > one which had always been promised in the Torah, Prophets and Psalms. The
  > radical newness, then, does not alter the fact that Paul's theology is still
  > a 'revision' of Jewish theology, rather than a scheme drawn from
  > elsewhere.[^28]

* In addition to there being no break in theology from Israel to the Church,
  there is also no historical break

  > There is, however, a phenomenon which is alive and well today, including in
  > some prestigious places, which we might call 'sweeping supersessionism'.
  > This is the sweeping claim &hellip; that what happened in Jesus Christ
  > constituted such a radical inbreaking or 'invasion' into the world that it
  > rendered redundant anything and everything that had gone before &ndash;
  > particularly anything that looked like 'religion', not least 'covenantal
  > religion'. This view is unlike 'hard supersessionism' because it denies that
  > there is any historical continuity at all; it isn't that 'Israel' has
  > 'turned into the church', but rather that Israel, and everything else prior
  > to the apocalyptic announcement of the gospel, has been swept aside by fresh
  > revelation[^30]

There is a lot more to Wright's arguments and I encourage anyone who is
interested to learn more about this topic to read his books.  Nevertheless, the
excerpts I have included above are, I think, sufficient to show that Paul and
other early Christians did not hold to the 'sweeping supersessionism' Wright
mentioned. On the contrary, Christians were part of God's family, Christians
held Israel's history to be their own history, Christians saw Jesus as the
fulfilment of Israel's hopes (and the real Temple), Christians saw themselves as
the continuation of Israel (with Jesus as the true Israel) and inheriting
Israel's task. Not only is the Old Testament useful for us to understand our
history and we need to reject the idea that Jesus has 'rendered redundant
anything and everything that \[has\] gone before'. Israel's 'covenant religion'
is the Christian's religion.

As I read Amos 3, I've been thinking of some interesting parallels between the
Israel of Amos' day and the church. There was a national Israel, filled with
people who thought they would inherit the benefits of the covenant without
living in relationship with God (they held on to the promises); in a similar
way, there is a visible church, filled with people who think they will inherit
the benefits of Christ's work but who don't have a living relationship with God
through Christ. And there was a real, or true Israel (Amos, one assumes, was a
member of this true Israel) that both inherited the promises of the covenant and
took its requirements seriously, living in relationship with God; in a similar
way, there is the invisible church, the true church of God, whose members are
truly *in Christ*, who take the requirements of the Christian life seriously and
who begin to benefit from Christ's work now and will receive the full benefit in
the future.

In light of this, I think we need to take what we've learnt from Amos about how
God deals with Israel and, as we worship the same God who has not changed,
realise that God can deal with the church in the same way.  Just as the fact
that national Israel (technically though not practically) was God's people,
known by him did not protect them from the punishment of serious persistent
apostasy, the visible church cannot claim the promises of Christ as somehow
protecting it against the righteous judgement of God against serious sin. Amos
threatened Israel with destruction &ndash; the nation of Israel was to be no
more; there was never a threat of the true Israel being destroyed (we know that
God had a plan to finally rescue his people through Jesus). Similarly, the
visible church may be destroyed, its buildings may be destroyed, its hierarchy
disbanded, its influence on society diminished, its reputation ruined &ndash;
this may be the righteous judgement of God against those who claim to be his
people but live in total opposition to everything this means. The true Israelite
need not despair at Amos' words, at the possibility of future judgement against
the nation of Israel; the true Christian need not despair at anything that
happens to the visible church.

Despair isn't needed, but fear and trembling is. When Amos delivered this
judgement against Israel we're told *fear* was the appropriate response and
those who followed God and listened to his prophets would have been jolted out
of any complacency they had when Amos delivered his message. The same is true
for us today, when the forces of this world seem to be working against the
church I think we should be asking ourselves if it's truly God working against
the church and, if it is, we should tremble with fear, we should be jolted out
of any complacency we have and we should repent.

> We who follow in the footsteps of Christ may also be tempted to the terrible
> error of an idolatry&ndash;-be it illicit sex, money, power, or false
> doctrine. If we fall to any of these, we may need severe chastisement to
> advance our sanctification. How much better to flee from them (1 Cor. 6:18; 1
> Tim. 6:11; 2 Tim. 2:22) and to put on the full armor of God (Eph.
> 6:10&ndash;18).[^30]

> Tradition taught that Israel was elect. God elected and redeemed his people

> Amos' audience because it is contrary to their orthodoxy.  *This happened
> because their orthodoxy eliminated the dynamic of a trusting relationship with
> God and substituted a static non-relational guaranteed benefit based on
> covenant promises of blessing.*[^31]

Smith says that the *orthodox* belief had 'eliminated the dynamic of a trusting
relationship with God' and replaced it with a 'static non-relational guaranteed
benefit'. Honestly, I think this is happening in the church today. I don't think
it's limited to proponents of so-called 'free grace theology', I think it's
present anywhere people teach that the initial moment of salvation is the main
event (whether they teach it as an explicit doctrine or it's just a belief borne
out in their practice) and that lifelong sanctification (that requires
continual, active engagement in relationship with God) is a sideshow at best.

## III.2. Falling Out of God's Favour

Amos paints us a picture of Israel: they are opulent, they have false religion,
they trust in promises instead of living in relationship, they have forgotten
how to distinguish right from wrong. Things have gotten so bad that the two
witnesses Amos calls, the wealthy of Ashdod and Egypt (v. 9) were from nations
Amos had just announced God's judgement against (Ashdod, cf. 2:8) and Israel's
historical enemy (Egypt, from whom God rescued them, cf. 2:10). Amos seems to be
saying that, as bad as the other nations are, Israel is worse; as deserving of
judgement as the other nations are, they still have more of a grip on what it
means to do right than does Israel.[^32]

I don't think it's drawing too long a bow to connect this with some of the ways
in which society has called the church to account in recent years. Truths of God
have been twisted to support racism, oppression, hatred, greed. Some church
elders and leaders have used their positions to sexually abuse people while
others have acted to protect abusers or simply turned a blind eye to the
situation. The church has, I think, acted far too passively when it comes to
environmental concerns; we have ignored the task God has given us. There are
doubtless further evils and abuses to be uncovered and God is using people who
are not his children to bring justice where his children have brought injustice.
I wonder what Amos would say to this.

> Pusey recalls the imaginative way in which Cyprian, commenting on this
> passage, calls on 'Jews, Turks and all Hagarenes' to behold the sins of
> Christendom: '" &hellip; a world reeking with mutual slaughter; and homicide,
> a crime in individuals, called virtue when wrought by nations" &hellip;
> immortal man glued to passing, perishable things! Men, redeemed by the blood
> of Jesus Christ, for lucre wrong their brethren, redeemed by the same price,
> the same Blood! No marvel then that the Church is afflicted, and encompassed
> by unseen enemies and her strength drawn down from her spoiled houses.' The
> only way in which this striking comment needs to be made appropriate to the
> present day of the church is that our enemies are no longer unseen.[^33]

As I quoted above, Alec Motyer says this:

> We have forgotten that our God can turn and become our enemy (Is.  63:10) and
> with all our talk of taking care not to fall into the power of Satan we have
> become blind to the much more dangerous possibility of falling out of the
> power of God.[^34]

Motyer refers to Isaiah 63:10:

> Yet the rebelled\
> []{style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"}and grieved his Holy Spirit.\
> So he turned and became their enemy\
> []{style="width:20pt; display:inline-block"}and he himself fought against them.

If this is true, it is certainly an inconvenient truth. One I'd much rather
forget, which is how I expect Amos' audience felt about his message. Motyer goes
on to say that

> Nothing which has taken place in Christ renders this truth void. We are God's
> covenant people, subject to His covenant blessings or His covenant curses. A
> study of the Letters of Jesus to the Seven Churches (Rev. 2:1 ff.) is
> particularly revealing in this connection (*e.g.* 2:5, 16, 23; 3:3, 16).

When I first read Amos 3 and started thinking about the relationship between
Israel and the church, several things came to mind: (1) Jesus' words to the
churches in Revelation 2&ndash;3, and (2) Jesus' words about true and false
disciples in Matthew 7 (3) the parable of the wheat and the tares in Matthew 13

* In Matthew 7, we learn that there are many who will believe they belong to
  Christ who don't, to whom Jesus will say 'Away from me, you evildoers!'
  (Matthew 7:23b).

* In Matthew 13, Jesus reinforces this same truth and warns us not to attempt to
  pull out the weeds as '\[we\] may uproot the wheat with them' (Matthew
  13:29b).

* Finally, in Revelation we're told that if the Ephesian Christians do not
  repent, Jesus 'will come to \[them\] and remove \[their\] lampstand from its
  place' (Revelation 2:5). In Revelation 1:20, we are told that 'the seven
  lampstands are the seven churches'. Jesus seems to be saying that it's
  possible for Christians to lose their ability to be a church.

I haven't done any serious study on these passages and I'm sure my understanding
will mature, but, in light of both Amos and Jesus' words in Matthew and
Revelation I think Motyer was right when he said that we can become enemies of
God. And, if you look at the big picture of the church (at least in the wealthy
west), I think it looks frighteningly similar to the Israel of Amos' day.

I'll leave you with this quote:

> When the people of God behave towards each other as though the seamless robe
> of fellowship in Christ did not matter, when they are careless about social
> justice and welfare, when they lord it, insensitively, over others in things
> great or small, when they forget about a personal walk with God,
> Bible-reading, prayer, the fellowship of other believers, the Lord's Table,
> testimony to Jesus&ndash;-these are rebellions, disobediences, contradictions
> of the known will of God for our lives. And there is no point in expecting
> anything but powerlessness and the adversity of an alienated God as long as we
> tarry in the place of rebellion.[^35]

    I'm not sure if this is simply a different usage of language or if Calvin
    sees something that I don't see in these verses, but he refers to the people
    in v. 9 as *judges*: 'Amos begins here to set judges over the Israelites;
    for they would not patiently submit to God's judgment: and he constitutes
    and sets over them as judges the Egyptians and Idumeans.' (Calvin,
    *Commentaries on the Twelve Minor Prophets,* 213)

    Smith points out that calling Egypt and Ashdod satisfies the requirement for
    two witnesses we see in Deuteronomy 17:6 and 19:15. (Smith, *Amos,* 161)
